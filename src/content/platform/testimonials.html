                    <h2>Dale Thoma,
                        from Saab Grintek Systems, contracted to the South African National Defence Force</h2>
                    <p>Of the competing products, the NetBeans Platform proved to be the
                        most straightforward for implementation. The fact that the NetBeans
                        Platform relies only on Ant scripts to build contributed greatly to our
                        choice. Also, the NetBeans Platform's use of pure Swing (as opposed to Eclipseâ€™s
                        use of SWT) means that integration with other products is seamless.
                        The NetBeans Platform does not force the design architecture to adhere to any
                        constraints such as the OSGi framework - Eclipse and (optionally Spring RCP) make use of OSGi.
                    <p>Ease of implementation in
                        the NetBeans Platform allows intermediate level programmers to partake in the
                        development process with less training. The NetBeans Platform was more pure in
                        using vanilla Java as opposed to Eclipse; this allows us to migrate
                        to other future technology frameworks should there be a need. The use
                        of Swing and vanilla Java makes the NetBeans Platform the best-suited product for
                        OS independence i.e. running on both Windows and Linux platforms.

                    <p>When I started working on my desktop project, I came
                        up with a list of more than twenty specific features
                        that the framework would need to support. I then examined
                        the available frameworks to see how well they matched these
                        criteria and a colleague suggested that I add the NetBeans
                        Platform to my candidate list. I'm glad I did because it
                        had more of the features we needed than any of the others.

                    <p>Recently, I released my first ever commercial desktop project based on the NetBeans Platform.
                        For this application, I embedded JavaDB into the NetBeans Platform, while reporting was done with
                        JasperReports. The window system the NetBeans Platform provides, together with the wizard-oriented operations,
                        are great and my client is really happy with what they've ended up with.
                    <p>They also appreciate the modular architecture, enabling the agile methodology that drove the
                        implementation. I've been able to add functionality, withdraw others, and update according to
                        customer needs, without breaking any of the working parts! And that is just "Wow."
                    <p>Overall, it was a great experience and, as I said, this is my first ever desktop application, opening
                        up a whole new horizon with new opportunities.

                    <h2>David Beer,
                        Independent Contractor, in England</h2>
                    <p>I first started using the NetBeans Platform
                        when my requirements for the my application
                        changed. I was writing the standard window
                        layout every time, and I had started created a new application
                        which would also take a long time to finish, so I
                        decided to look for a framework to use as a starting point.</p>
                    <p>I was already using the the NetBeans IDE
                        which is built on the NetBeans Platform, so
                        I looked at the NetBeans Platform and the Eclipse
                        RCP. I wanted a cross-platform application
                        and the UI needed to be
                        the same on all operating systems. This ruled Eclipse RCP
                        out as it isn't Swing-based, but the NetBeans Platform is.</p>
                    <p>My other big requirement was to have a modular
                        application so that anyone can add functionality
                        or extend the application easily and with the
                        update center in NetBeans this worked well.</p>
                    <p>I will be continuing to use the NetBeans Platform
                        and to push its use where I can.</p>

                    <h2>Ibon Urrutia,
                        from MTEC, in Marbella, Spain</h2>
                    <p>From my point of view the benefit of the NetBeans
                        Platform isn't a specific module, but its modular architecture:
                        Goodbye JAR Hell! You can safely change some of the platform
                        modules (as we did with the XML editor) to create your own
                        personal platform. Updates and dependencies are managed by
                        the platform. Communication mechanism between modules is
                        really decoupled; unit tests are easily performed; functional
                        testing is like writing a simple script. These are benefits
                        you discover when developing a complex application and you
                        realize that in the NetBeans Platform you have the holy
                        grail of great development: modularity.
                    <p>But if I have to mention some modules, I do appreciate the Project API,
                        which is so comprehensive that our TagsMe project didn't need one
                        nor an ant build.xml in order to have an active Java module.
                        The FileSystem API, a wonderful abstraction that allows you to
                        access xml tags as folders and files in a file system. And
                        also as I said, it's wonderful that a programmer with so little
                        experience in Swing can develop an IDE (one of the hardest desktop
                        applications you can think of) in a few months.

                    <h2>Jeremy Moore,
                        from ThinkingRock, in Australia</h2>
                    <p>We first just built ThinkingRock without using any
                        platform at all, but soon realized that we were re-inventing
                        the wheel in many aspects. For example, there was no need for
                        us to implement our own drag-and-drop when that problem had
                        been solved already. We then looked at various platforms,
                        with the main contenders at the time being Eclipse and NetBeans.
                    <p>We first looked at using Eclipse, but found it lacking.
                        Our main reason for discarding it was their poor implementation
                        of the Standard Widget Toolkit. Basically, it worked great on
                        Windows, but not so great on the Mac. And, support for SWT
                        was either buggy or non-existent on some platforms.
                        (In fairness, the situation is probably a bit better today).
                    <p>We wanted our application to work on as many platforms as possible,
                        therefore we felt we needed a 100% Java solution. We also evaluated
                        other platforms, but most were just getting started. They either
                        lacked some functionality we really wanted, such as a plug-in architecture.
                        Either that, or they were not mature enough.
                    </p>
                    <p>The NetBeans Platform is 100% Java, and has the plug-in architecture
                        that we needed, for starters. Also, it's now a mature IDE. I like the
                        fact that it's open source and it's continually improving. Also,
                        the NetBeans community spirit is a real plus.

                        from Eppleton, in Munich, Germany</h2>
                    <p>I like the NetBeans Platform in general. When I started
                        working with it, I discovered much more functionality to
                        reuse than I would ever have expected. About four years ago
                        I had to write my own rich-client
                        platform with an application launcher, splash screen,
                        update and download managers, preferences, proxy handling
                        and so on. With the NetBeans Platform all that stuff is
                        there for free. And there is so much more like the Window
                        system, the Lookup API, Projects, the FileSystems API,
                        Wizards, you name it. Working with the NetBeans Platform
                        really speeds up development for rich-client platform
                        applications.

                        from Sketsa, in Surabaya, Indonesia</h2>
                    <p>When the buzzword "RCP" came out, we started evaluating the
                        available RCPs. At that time, we didn't know that the NetBeans Platform
                        was available, because to us there was only NetBeans IDE, so naturally
                        we looked at Eclipse RCP. During the evaluation period, we found that Eclipse
                        RCP was too tightly integrated with SWT. In order to fully utilize or derive
                        benefits from Eclipse RCP, we would have had to use SWT to create a Workspace
                        manager, with menus and dialogs, preferences, options, etc. Although we found
                        that we could choose to not use SWT, we found that doing so meant losing the
                        benefits of RCP. It would only have left us with the OSGi modular framework,
                        since the rest of the RCP features, such as the integrated Workspace or
                        Window manager, requires the use of SWT.</p>
                    <p>What we needed was the whole application framework, including menus,
                        preferences, workspace system, windows and dialogs system, etc, and it
                        had to be Swing because our application is Swing-based. Luckily, not long
                        after that, NetBeans folks started to publicize more heavily the spinning
                        of NetBeans Platform from the IDE.

                        on the actual core of your application. The wizards make it simple to
                        add menu items, toolbar buttons, windows, option panels, to set up an
                        update center and so forth.
                    <p>And with "Matisse", the Swing GUI builder,
                        you can visually design your components, which facilitates layout
                        management. Also, the integrated preview is very nice to test
                        the resize behavior on the fly.
                    <p>The NetBeans Platform has many useful APIs to create
                        wizards (Dialogs API), projects (Project API, Project UI API),
                        custom file types (File System API, Datasystems API, Nodes API),
                        and graphical representations (Visual Library), just to name a few...
                    <p>So all in all, you don't have to reinvent the wheel for the development
                        of basic application functionality.

                    <p>We use the NetBeans Platform because it is an extensible modular application built on Java.
                        The window management side of things: the way you can put together parts of the application
                        and get all the benefits of the windowing system; the APIs and building wizards with them;
                        these were all very important to us. Eclipse has its own native widgets,
                        UI and visual components, which were difficult to manipulate.
                        NetBeans is Java-based and has a straight-forward framework that  was very helpful
                        in creating a Swing-heavy application like Instant JChem.

                    <h2>Oliver Rettig,
                        from ORAT, in Karlsruhe, Germany</h2>
                    <p>I have developed desktop applications for scientific research for
                        more than ten years. Mostly I've been interested in algorithms.
                        At the start, I tried to create plain Swing-based GUIs, but with less
                        and less success since I was not able to establish a
                        GUI-framework of the kind of quality needed for it to
                        be successfully maintained over time.

                    <p>That's when I switched to an Ant-based user interface. My algorithms
                        were encapsulated in Ant tasks and with Ant build scripts I controlled
                        the data processing. Via NetBeans IDE, I had access to these scripts.

                    <p>Some years ago I discovered the existence of the NetBeans Platform.
                        I recalled all the problems and the lack of features involved in my old plain Swing
                        experiments. It didn't take me long to get
                        enthusiastic about the NetBeans Platform. It turned out to
                        have been created to fit my needs exactly.
                    <p>Currently I am doing my PhD in in the field of medical
                        motion (gait) analysis. I am developing a very large
                        modeling application, called Nimue, based on the NetBeans Platform.
                        I hope to finish this work this year by publishing
                        an open source community version of this software.

                    <p>The added value is that it's Swing. Before the NetBeans experience,
                        I had looked quickly at Eclipse RCP; at the time it was probably the only
                        viable framework for developing desktop applications. But I hated the idea
                        of learning a new set of APIs: Eclipse is based on its own SWT... and throwing
                        away my knowledge, even though limited at the time, of the Swing APIs.
                    <p>Furthermore, I felt that if you deal with photography you need to provide
                        a pleasant user interface beyond mere effectiveness. Swing had a good foundation
                        in this area, even though developing a new Look-and-Feel was a pain initially.
                        Today Swing provides a huge set of Look-and-Feel choices (Substance, Synthetica,
                        Nimrod, to mention a few) and when Jasper Potts finishes his new Nimbus Look-and-Feel
                        and the related design tools we'll go another leap forward. And
                        with the tremendous evangelizing effort of people such as Romain Guy,
                        people tdday should have no doubt about Swing's ability to realize rich clients.
                        As far as I know, there's nothing of the sort in the SWT world.

                        from Sepix, in Germany</h2>
                    <p>Well, I've used the NetBeans IDE since the end of the '90's and have
                        been, since that time, closely following the open sourcing of the related APIs
                        into its current form as a fully-fledged Swing framework. With the 6.0 release
                        I saw the time had come to migrate my current Swing projects to a new level
                        of technology. The old plain Swing CRM system could function better if it were
                        based on a modern desktop platform.
                    <p>Many components, which I had already programmed, were no longer modern
                        and were increasingly difficult to maintain. I simply didn't have the
                        time to redo all the basic things all over again. With a framework, such as
                        that offered by the NetBeans Platform, I wanted to save a large portion
                        of my development time and energy.
