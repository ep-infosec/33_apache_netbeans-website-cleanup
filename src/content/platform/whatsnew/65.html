        <h1>What's New in NetBeans Platform 6.5?</h1>

<p>An overview of changes relating to <a href="https://platform.netbeans.org/">NetBeans Platform 6.5</a>, which is the
 Swing framework that underpins applications such as NetBeans IDE.

<h3>New & Changed Features</h3>

<ul>
    <p><li><b>More Control over Window System.</b> If your application
     makes use of the NetBeans Window System, you can limit the
     features made available to your users. Previously, you had no
     control over this: the windows were draggable, minimizable, resizable,
     closeable. Now, there are properties that specify whether these
     features are available, which are set for all the windows
     in the window system at the same time.
    <p><li><b>Possibility of Dragging into Palette.</b> The palettes
     that you create for editors can now be populated by snippets
     dragged from the editor. The HTML Editor in NetBeans IDE 6.5
     already supports this: the user can drag snippets from the editor
     into the palette. You can enable the same feature for your
     own editors too.
    <p><li><b>Replacement for TreeTableView.</b> The TreeTableView has
    long been considered overly complex and buggy. In 6.5, you can use
    the OutlineView instead. It supports drag and drop, in-place editing of
    tree cells, and enhanced sorting. The data model is compatible with
    that of TreeTableViews.
    <p><li><b>More Control over Options Window.</b> Since there are now
    so many options available in the Options window, being able to programmatically
    open a specific tab within the Options window can be handy. This is now
    possible via changes made to the Options API.
    <p><li><b>More Control over Minimized Window.</b> When a window is
    minimized, and the user then slides it out, it is now possible to
    specify the size of the slided out window.
   <p><li><b>Simplified Test Infrastructure Replaces XTest.</b> The XTest
    infrastructure, which was considered too complex, has been replaced
    by a simpler approach to testing, as explained <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/FitnessTestsWithoutX">here</a>
    and <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/DevFaqUsingSimpletests">here</a>.
</ul>

<h3>New APIs & SPIs</h3>

<p>Read all of the changes <a href="http://bits.netbeans.org/6.5/javadoc/apichanges.html">here</a>, with
 new classes as follows:

<ul>
    <p><li><b>Code Generator SPI.</b> You can now plug new code generation
     functionality into the popup that appears when Alt-Enter is clicked
     in an editor. This feature is registered by MIME type in the layer, so
     that code generators can now be created for any type of editor.
     <a href="http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-netbeans-modules-editor-lib2/org/netbeans/spi/editor/codegen/package-summary.html">Read the Javadoc.</a>
    <p><li><b>Quick Search API.</b> A new feature in NetBeans IDE 6.5 is
    a drop-down list that displays actions, options, and help texts that match
    a specified string. Selected actions are then invoked, selected options are shown
    in the Options window, and help texts are shown in the JavaHelp window. There
    is also an API that you can use to plug your own items into this quick search
    feature. <a href="http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-netbeans-spi-quicksearch/overview-summary.html">Read the Javadoc.</a>
    <p><li><b>OutlineView API.</b> New class that replaces the TreeTableView.
    <a href="http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-explorer/org/openide/explorer/view/OutlineView.html">Read the Javadoc.</a>
    <p><li><b>Database Explorer API.</b> Provides access to database connections
     and drivers defined in the NetBeans Database Explorer, in the Services window.
     <a href="http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-netbeans-modules-db/overview-summary.html">Read the Javadoc.</a>
    <p><li><b>Print API.</b> Provides Print functionality for your
     window components. <a href="http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-netbeans-modules-print/overview-summary.html">Read the Javadoc.</a>
</ul>

<h3>Deprecations</h3>
<p>The following are deprecated/obsolete from 6.5 onwards:
<ul>

<li><b>In org.openide.loaders.DataObject:</b>
<ul>
    <li>DataObject.getCookie is now DataObject.getLookup().lookup(Object.class)
</ul>

<li><b>In org.openide.nodes:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Node.getCookie is now Node.getLookup().lookup(Object.class)
</ul>

<li><b>In org.openide.text.Line:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Line.show
</ul>

<li><b>In org.openide.util:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Utilities.icon2Image is now ImageUtilities.icon2Image
    <li>Utilities.loadImage is now ImageUtilities.loadImage
    <li>Utilities.mergeImages is now ImageUtilities.mergeImages
</ul>

</ul>

<h3>New & Changed Tools in NetBeans IDE 6.5</h3>

<ul>
    <p><li><b>Project Properties Dialog.</b> New tab in NetBeans Platform project type's Project Properties
     dialog. The new tab is called 'Window System' and lets you specify
     whether the windows in the window system are draggable, closeable, etc.
     <p><li><b>New Module Project Wizard.</b> There is a new checkbox which
     you need to select if you want the wizard to create a layer file for
     your module.
    <p><li><b>New File Dialog Wizards.</b> Two new wizards in the
    New File dialog, for generating a starting point for using
    two of the new API/SPIs listed: Code Generator and Quick Search.
    <p><li><b>Improved File Dialog Wizards.</b> Some artifacts are no longer
     created. Instead, new entries are added to the layer for artifacts
     that used to be created but were typically never changed:
     <ul>
     <li><b>New Window Component wizard:</b> now no action
     is created by this wizard. Instead, it is wrapped in the layer file, where new
     entries are added for this purpose. In addition, there is
     a new checkbox 'Keep preferred size when slided in', which lets
     you specify whether your window should support the new feature that
     gives you control over the slided-out window.
    <li><b>New File Type wizard:</b> no data loader and
     no node are created. Instead, these are wrapped in the layer, where
     they are declared.
    <li><b>New Action wizard:</b> if you select an 'Always Enabled' action, the wizard
     will create a standard JDK ActionListener class, instead of a CallableSystemAction.
     New entries are registered in the layer, which maps your ActionListener to its
     NetBeans API requirements.
    <li><b>New Options Window wizard:</b> now you
     can specify whether your new tab will be a miscellaneous tab
     within one of your own Options window tabs.
     </ul>
</ul>

<h3>New Video Series</h3>

<p>A new series of screencasts is introduced in 6.5, to get you started with gaining
 a conceptual understanding of the NetBeans Platform. Guided by the screencasts,
 you will understand the NetBeans Platform's problem domain and you will see the
 main APIs in action via a series
 of demonstrations using NetBeans IDE. The current parts of the series are as follows:

 <ul>
     <li><a href="http://netbeans.dzone.com/news/video-part-1-introduction-netb-0">Part 1: Runtime Container</a>
     <li><a href="http://netbeans.dzone.com/news/top-10-netbeans-apis-part-2">Part 2: Lookup API</a>
     <li><a href="http://netbeans.dzone.com/news/top-10-netbeans-apis-part-3">Part 3: Window System API</a>
     <li><a href="http://netbeans.dzone.com/news/video-part-4-introduction-netb">Part 4: System Filesystem API</a>
 </ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> The topics in this series are also covered in the <a href="http://edu.netbeans.org/courses/nbplatform-certified-training/">NetBeans
 Platform Certified Training</a>.

<p>More coming soon...

<h3>New Teaching Materials</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://edu.netbeans.org/courses/nbplatform-certified-training/">NetBeans Platform Certified Training</a> has been delivered to a number
 of companies and institutions during the 6.5 release cycle and a new page
 has been created, for ALL the slides ever made by anyone in
 relation to the NetBeans Platform:

 <ul>
     <li><a href="http://edu.netbeans.org/contrib/slides/netbeans-platform/">NetBeans Platform Teaching Resources</a>
 </ul>

 <p>The page is useful to <u>teachers</u> of the NetBeans Platform, i.e., either
  to people who are giving one-off presentations or to those who are giving
  full-blown courses covering several days to newbies or advanced users
  of the NetBeans Platform. If you have slides that should be added to the list,
  please join & write to nbedu@netbeans.org saying so.
