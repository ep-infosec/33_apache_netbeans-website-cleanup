    <h1>NetBeans Platform Runtime Container Tutorial</h1>
     
    <p>This tutorial covers the most fundamental concept in the NetBeans Platform&#8212;the runtime
     container. The runtime container is the execution environment for the modules that define
     a NetBeans Platform application. It consists of 5 modules provided by the NetBeans Platform.
     In this tutorial, we will look at these 5 modules, and use them in a very simple modular
     application.
     
    <p>Before going further, you can watch this video, which covers the same material as the
     rest of this tutorial:

    <p><h2 class="tutorial"><a name="intro"></a>Introduction to the Runtime Container</h2>

    <p>The "NetBeans runtime container" is the collective name for these 5
    NetBeans Platform modules:</p>

    <p><img src="https://platform.netbeans.org/images/tutorials/runtime-container/runtime-container.jpg"/></p>

    <p>Brief overview of each of these 5 modules:

    <ul>
         <li>Bootstrap&#8212;Enables the runtime container to understand what
          a module is and how to load and compose them into one application.
         <li>Startup&#8212;Provides the main method of your application, as well
          as all the code needed for starting it up.
         <li>Filesystem API&#8212;Gives your application a filesystem.
         <li>Module System API&#8212;Lets you influence the lifecycle of
          the modules in your application.
         <li>Utilities API&#8212;Includes many utility classes, especially
          the Lookup class, which is used for communication between modules.
    </ul>
    
    <p><h2 class="tutorial"><a name="setup"></a>Setting up the Runtime Container</h2>

    <p>In this section, we will create an absolutely minimal NetBeans Platform application.
     It will consist of only those modules that every NetBeans Platform application must
     have&#8212;the 5 modules that make up the runtime container. Once we have create
     an application that consists of nothing more than these 5 modules, we will run it.
     There will be no specific output from this application. However, it will build and
     run successfully because all the fundamental requirements of a NetBeans Platform
     application will have been met.

    <ol>
        <li><p>Go to File &gt; New Project. In the New Project dialog, choose
        NetBeans Modules &gt; NetBeans Platform Application:</p>
        <p><img src="https://platform.netbeans.org/images/tutorials/htmleditor/new-nb-app-wiz-65.png"/></p>
        <p>Click Next.</p>
        <li>Name your application 'Hello World'. Click Finish.
        <li>Right-click the main project node in the Projects window,
         choose Properties, and go to the Libraries tab. There you can
         see all the modules that are part of this application.
        <li>In addition to the runtime container, many other modules are
         included. Exclude them now. Make sure that ONLY the 5 modules that make
         up the runtime container are included.
    </ol>

    <p>Run the application and notice that the application successfully
     executes.

    <p><h2 class="tutorial"><a name="add"></a>Loading a New Module into the Runtime Container</h2>

    <p>In this section, we add one new module to the NetBeans runtime container. The new
     module will do nothing special. The only reason for adding it will be so that you
     can see that it will be an equal partner to the other modules in your application.
     You will have six modules instead of 5: in addition to the 5 modules that you
     already have, you will also have your custom module.

    <p>Next, we will influence the module's lifecycle. When it is loaded into the
     runtime container, we will use one of the module's lifecycle methods to send
     a 'Hello World' message to the Output window.

     <ol>

         <li>Right-click the application's Modules node and choose 'Add New...'.
          Click Next.

         <li>Give your module a project name and a code name base.
          Click Finish. You now have a new module.

         <li>Right-click the module, choose New &gt; Other, and then choose
          Module Development &gt; Module Installer.
          Click Next and then complete the wizard. You now have a new
          class that extends 'ModuleInstaller', which is from the Module
          System API.

         <li>Add a new 'System.out.println' message in the 'restored' method of
          the Installer class.

     </ol>

     <p>Run the application again and notice the 'Hello World' message in the Output window.
