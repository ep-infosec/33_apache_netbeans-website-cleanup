    <a name="1"></a>
    <h2>Setting up the Rich-Client Application Project</h2>

    <p>As a first step, you set up a new skeleton rich-client application.</p>

    <ol>
        <p><li>Choose File &gt; New Project (Ctrl-Shift-N). Under Categories, select NetBeans Plug-in Modules. Under projects, 
        select Module Suite Project. Click Next.</li>
        
        <p>The New Module Suite Project wizard appears.</P></li>
        
        <p><li>In the Name and Location panel, type <tt>ContactEditor</tt> in Project Name.
        Change the
        Project Location to any directory on your computer.  Click Finish.

        <P>You have now set up a skeleton for your rich-client application. Now you need a module project
        to hold the application's functionality.</P></li>
    
        <p><li>Expand the <tt>ContactEditor</tt> application project, right-click the Modules node,
        and click Add New...

        <p>The New Module Project wizard appears.</P></li>
     
        <p><li>In the Name and Location panel, type <tt>ContactEditorUI</tt> in Project Name.
        Change the
        Project Location to any directory on your computer.  Select Set as Main Project. Click Next.
        
        <p><li>In the Basic Module Configuration panel, type <tt>org.netbeans.modules.contacteditorui</tt> in 
        Code Name Base. Click Finish.
        
    </ol>

    <p> You have now created a skeleton <tt>ContactEditor</tt>
    application project that contains a skeleton module that will contain
    your functionality. The project contains all of your sources and
    project metadata, such as the application's Ant build script. The application
    opens in the IDE. You can view its logical structure in the Projects window (Ctrl-1) and its
    file structure in the Files window (Ctrl-2). 

    
    <a name="2"></a>
    <h2>Creating a Window Component</h2>

    <P>In the <a href="https://netbeans.org/download/dev/javadoc/">NetBeans APIs</a>, a window component is called a 
    <a href="https://netbeans.org/download/dev/javadoc/org-openide-windows/org/openide/windows/TopComponent.html">TopComponent</a>.
    A TopComponent can be placed in a variety of different
    locations in the IDE or in your own application built on the NetBeans Platform. You can use a 
    wizard to create a window component. When you use the wizard, you choose the window component's location
    when you create the window component.  
    <ol>
        <p><li>In the Projects window, right-click the <tt>ContactEditorUI</tt> project node
        and select New &gt; Window Component. 
        <p>The New Window Component wizard appears.</li>
        <p><li>In the Basic Settings panel, select <tt>editor</tt> in the Window Position drop-down list.  
        Select Open on Application Start to make the new window automatically
        open when the application starts. Click Next.</li>
        <p><li>In the Name, Icon and Location panel, enter <tt>ContactEditor</tt> in Class Name Prefix, to specify the prefix for the
        files that the wizard will generate. You could specify an icon to use with you window component. Leave this field empty for now. 
        Accept the default for the package name. Click Finish.</li>
    </ol>

        <P>The wizard creates several files in the
            <tt>ContactEditorUI</tt> project. You see these files when you expand the
            <tt>ContactEditorUI</tt> project node in the IDE's Projects window. The two
            most significant files are <tt>ContactEditorAction.java</tt> and
            <tt>ContactEditorTopComponent.java</tt>. The first defines the menu item that
            will be displayed in the Window menu and the second defines the window component itself.
        </P>

        <a name="3"></a>
        <h2>Designing the Window Component</h2>

        <P>Next, you will design the newly created Window Component.  
        The file opens in the GUI Builder when you complete the wizard. It displays an empty GUI form.
        You will now add components to this form.
    </p>

    <P>You will create the same contact editor that you create if you follow the
    <a href="https://netbeans.org/kb/50/quickstart-gui.html">GUI Building in NetBeans IDE 5.0 Tutorial</a>.
    There are a couple subtle differences, though. 
    The first is that, unlike in the <a href="https://netbeans.org/kb/50/quickstart-gui.html">GUI Building in NetBeans IDE 5.0 Tutorial</a>,
    the <tt>ContactEditorTopComponent</tt> class is
    a JPanel, instead of a JFrame.  Later, you will add additional JPanels to this
    TopComponent and add other Swing components to those additional
    JPanels.</P>

    <ol>
        <p><li>If you do not see the Palette or the Properties Window, 
        first choose Window &gt; Palette and Window &gt; Properties from the main menu.
        <p><li>Drag a JPanel item from the Palette onto the form designer. 
        <p><li>Use the Matisse look and feel guidelines to place the JPanel 
        at the proper spacing to make it fill the upper half of the box.
        <p><li>In the Properties Window, click the &quot;...&quot; button 
        next to the <tt>border</tt> property. A Property Editor opens.
        Set the JPanel's border to <tt>TitledBorder</tt>.
        In the <tt>Title</tt> field, enter the word <tt>Name</tt>.</li>
        <p><li>Click OK to save your changes to the JPanel.
    </ol> 
    Here's what you should have:</P>

    <P><img src="../../images/tutorials/topcomponent-tutorial/ContactEditorTopComponent6a3c7b72.png"
        alt="Screenshot: The empty JPanel box with a titled border labeled Name."  BORDER=0><BR>
    </P>

    <P>Next, you add Swing components to the <tt>Name</tt> panel.
    Since it is an embedded JPanel, 
    click on the <tt>Name</tt> panel to select it, then right-click inside the
    <tt>Name</tt> panel and select Design This Container as shown below:</P>

    <P><img src="../../images/tutorials/topcomponent-tutorial/ContactEditorTopComponent315cd1fa.png"
        alt="Screenshot: The JPanel's context menu with the Design This Container item selected."   BORDER=0><BR>
    </P>
    <P>Now the form designer's focus will be limited to the <tt>Name</tt> panel.</P>

    <P>Add the Swing components to the <tt>Name</tt> panel 
    to complete the contact editor portion needed for the <tt>Name</tt> panel, 
    as depicted below. 
    Look at the <A HREF="https://netbeans.org/kb/50/quickstart-gui.html">GUI Building in NetBeans IDE 5.0 Tutorial</a> again
    if you need assistance in creating the <tt>Name</tt> panel.
    When you have finished, your <tt>Name</tt> panel should look like the following:</P>

    <P><img src="../../images/tutorials/topcomponent-tutorial/ContactEditorTopComponent7b6e9613.png"
        alt="Screenshot: The Japanel with the first 5 labels and 5 text input fields."  BORDER=0><BR>
    </P>
    <P>You can preview the <tt>Name</tt> panel, by clicking the preview button
    <img src="../../images/tutorials/topcomponent-tutorial/ContactEditorTopComponent_preview-button.jpg" alt="preview button">.
    Notice the preview shows the entire <tt>TopComponent</tt> panel.
    Close the preview window by clicking the Close button.</P>

    <P>In the form designer, 
    right-click on the <tt>Name</tt> panel and select Design Top Container
    to go back to the TopComponent panel:</P>

    <P><img src="../../images/tutorials/topcomponent-tutorial/ContactEditorTopComponent72cd0b52.png" 
        alt="Screenshot: The JPanel context menu with the Design Top Container item selected." BORDER=0><BR>
    </P>
    <P>The complete TopComponent panel is visible again. 
        Next, you add the lower <tt>E-mail</tt> panel to the form.
    </P>

    <ol>
        <p><li>Drag another JPanel from the GUI palette onto the
        form designer just below the <tt>Name</tt> panel. 
        Again, use the Matisse look and feel guidelines 
        to place the JPanel at the proper spacing below the <tt>Name</tt> panel.</li>
        <p><li>Follow the same steps as above for the <tt>Name</tt> panel to 
        set the JPanel's border to a Titled Border, 
        this time with a title of <tt>E-mail</tt>. 
        <p><li>Stretch the panel to occupy the
        width of the TopComponent panel. Stop when the look and feel
        guidelines advise you of the correct spacing at the left and right
        edge of the TopComponent panel.</li>
        <p><li>As you did with the <tt>Name</tt> panel, select
        the <tt>E-mail</tt> panel, right-click on it and select Design this
        Container from the context menu.</li>
        <p><li>Add the Swing components to the <tt>E-mail</tt>
        panel. Again, feel free to look at the 
        <A HREF="https://netbeans.org/kb/50/quickstart-gui.html">GUI Building in NetBeans IDE 5.0 Tutorial</a> for
        more detailed instructions.</li>
        <p><li>Once you have finished adding the Swing components 
        for the <tt>E-mail</tt> panel, 
        you should have an <tt>E-mail</tt> panel that looks like this:
        <p><img src="../../images/tutorials/topcomponent-tutorial/ContactEditorTopComponentm66b3b86e.png"
        alt="Screenshot: The empty JPanel box with a titled border labeled E-Mail."  BORDER=0></p></li>
        <p><li>Right click on the <tt>Email</tt> panel and
        select Design Top Container to return to the TopComponent.  The
        TopComponent should look like the following in the form designer:
        <p><img src="../../images/tutorials/topcomponent-tutorial/ContactEditorTopComponentm1317ff51.png"
        alt="Screenshot: The complete Contact Editor form with all Name and E-Mail fields"   BORDER=0></p></li>
        <p><li>There's just a couple more Swing
        components to add: the OK and Cancel buttons. Refer
        back to the <A HREF="https://netbeans.org/kb/50/quickstart-gui.html">GUI Building in NetBeans IDE 5.0 Tutorial</a> 
        if you need a little help remember how to do it.</li>
    </ol>

    <P>The TopComponent should now look like the following:</P>

    <P><img src="../../images/tutorials/topcomponent-tutorial/ContactEditorTopComponentm6d28ccde.png" 
        alt="Screenshot: The complete Contact Editor form with all Name and E-Mail fields, 
        complete with OK and Cancel button below" BORDER=0><BR>
    </P>
    <P>That's it. It's time to see how this form looks in action.</P>

    <a name="4"></a>
    <h2>Running the Project</h2>

    <P>Right-click on the <tt>ContactEditorPlugin</tt>
    project name in the Projects window and select Run Project.
    This will launch a new NetBeans Platform with the contact editor you just
    created placed in the main editor window.  
    Notice under the NetBeans Platform's Window menu, 
    there's an option to open the Contact Editor window, too.</P>

    <P>Here's what the end result looks like (click to enlarge):</P>

        alt="Screenshot: The contact editor form is integrated into the IDE in the Editor location." BORDER=0></a><BR>
    </P>

    <P>
        This tutorial demonstrated how quickly you integrate a Matisse created UI 
        into the NetBeans Platform as a window component.
        In a real world application, you now implement the back services of
        the contact editor. 
        In the file <tt>ContactEditorTopComponent.java</tt>, switch to Source View.
        Click between two classes and hit the control-space key combination:
        The IDE assists you in creating getters and setters for your contact form.
        In <tt>ContactEditorTopComponent.java</tt>, you implement the response to events
        generated by the GUI.
    </P>

    <a name="8"></a>
    <h2>Distributing the Contact Form Application</h2>

    <P>To distribute your new application, you can publish the Contact Editor app 
    either as a NetBeans plug-in module or as a NetBeans rich-client application. 

    <div class="indent">
        <a name="6"></a>
        <h3  class="tutorial">Distributing the Form as a NetBeans Module</h3>

        <P>You can generate a standalone plug-in module,
        also know as an NBM, which can be loaded directly into the NetBeans IDE.</P> 

        <ol>
            <p><li>In the IDE's Projects window, right-click on the
            <tt>ContactEditorPlugin</tt> project and select Create NBM. 
            The IDE's Output window will tell you the
            location where the NBM file was created. 
            <p><li>Select Tools &gt; Update Center from the main menu. 
            In the Update Center Wizard, select the option 
            to Install Manually Downloaded Modules. Click Next.
            <p><li>Click Add and browse to the directory where the
            contact editor NBM file was generated, and select the NBM file. 
            Click OK and Next.
            <p><li>On the wizard's overview page, click Next and accept the (empty) license.  
            <p><li>When the Update Center wizards says done, again click Next to continue.
            <p><li>Select include and answer Yes to install your module.
            <p><li>Click Finish to close the Update Center wizard.
        </ol>

        <P>
            Look at the Window menu: It now has a Open ContactEditor Window menu item.
            Your contact form is now installed in this copy of the NetBeans IDE. 
        </P>

        <p>
        Note that it does not play any role where the NBM was created:
        it will load into a NetBeans Platform running on Windows,
        Linux, MacOS, Solaris or anywhere else you like to run the NetBeans Platform.
        In addition, you'll see the unser interface that you created with Matisse
        will automatically adjust to your target operating system's look and
        feel! One of the advantages of Matisse is that one distribution fits all.
        <p>

        <p>To uninstall a plug-in module, choose Tools &gt; Module Manager from
        the IDE's main menu and deselect the box next to the module you want removed.</p>
    </div>

    <a name="5"></a>
    <div class="indent">
        <h3 class="tutorial">Distributing the Form as Part of a Rich-Client Application</h3>

        <p>You can wrap your plug-in project in a Module Suite Project
        and let NetBeans IDE create a stand-alone executable. 
        The executable will be built on the NetBeans Platform, 
        but it will have its own splashscreen and menubar.</p>

        <ol>
            <p><li>Choose File &gt; New Project from the IDE's menu to open the New Project wizard. 
            To create a new plug-in module suite, 
            select NetBeans Plug-In Module &gt; Module Suite Project.
            Click Next to continue.</li>
            <p><li>In the Project Name field, enter <tt>ContactEditor</tt>.</li> 
            <p><li>Select a project location where you want to save your project.</li> 
            <p><li>Make sure Set as Main Project is selected.</li>
            <p><li>Click Finish. The Module Suite project appears in the IDE's Project window.</li>
            <p><li>Open the <tt>ContactEditor</tt> project tree. You see a <tt>Module</tt> node.
            Right-click the <tt>Module</tt> node and choose Add.... 
            In the File browser, select your <tt>ContactEditorPlugin</tt> project and 
            click Open Project Folder to add it to the module suite.
        </ol>

        <P>You have now wrapped your plug-in into a module suite.
        Next you will brand your application and let NetBeans IDE create the executable.
        The executable will be ZIP compressed and will be ready for distribution.

        <ol>
            <p><li>Right-click the <tt>ContactEditor</tt> node, choose Properties, and then click Application
            in the Project Properties dialog box.</li> 
            <p><li>Select Create Standalone Application and click Exclude. 
            When you do this, IDE-related modules are removed from the
            application. If, for example, you wanted your application to include 
            the libraries that provide the IDE with its editor
            functionalities, you would click Skip instead.
            <p><li>Type <tt>contacteditor</tt> in the Branding Name field. 
            This sets the name of the executable launcher that the IDE creates for
            ZIP distributions.</li>
            <p><li>Type <tt>Contact Editor</tt> in the Application Title field. 
            This sets the name that is displayed in the new application's title bar.
            <p><li>Click Splash Screen. Browse to an image file. Click OK to attach it to your project.</li>
            <p><li>Run the application again and notice the splash screen. Once the application has started up, notice
            that the title bar displays the title that you specified. Also, there are a lot less
            menu items, toolbar buttons, and other features.
            <p><li>Right-click the <tt>ContactEditor</tt> node, choose Build Zip-Distribution.
            Look into the Output window and note the path where the zip file has been created. 
            The relevant line looks similar to this example:
            <pre class="examplecode">Building zip: /home/joesmith/Applications/ContactEditor/dist/contacteditor.zip</pre></li>
        </ol>

        <p>By following these steps, you have created a NetBeans Rich-client
            Application featuring the contact form user interface.
            It is branded to display your custom splashscreen and is ready for distribution as a ZIP file. 
            To use the application, unzip the archive and run the file <tt>bin/contacteditor</tt>.
        </p>
