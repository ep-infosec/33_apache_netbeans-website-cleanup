        <h1>Writing POV-Ray Support for NetBeans X&#8212;Conclusion</h1>

        <p>This is a continuation of the tutorial for building POV-Ray support for
            NetBeans.  If you have not read the <a href="nbm-povray-1.html">first</a>,
            <a href="nbm-povray-2.html">second</a>, <a href="nbm-povray-3.html">third</a>,
            <a href="nbm-povray-4.html">fourth</a>, <a href="nbm-povray-5.html">fifth</a>,
            <a href="nbm-povray-6.html">sixth</a>, <a href="nbm-povray-7.html">seventh</a>,
            <a href="nbm-povray-8.html">eighth</a>, and <a href="nbm-povray-9.html">ninth</a>
            parts of this tutorial, you may want to start there.</p>
	<p>At this stage, you have completed the application, which should look like this:</p>
	<p><a href="../images/tutorials/povray/71/ch7/pic1.png"><img alt="" src="../images/tutorials/povray/71/ch7/pic2.png"/></a></p>
	<p>Additional steps to take to improve and enhance the application:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>Test your application. (See the <a href="https://platform.netbeans.org/tutorials/nbm-test.html">Test Infrastructure Tutorial</a>.)</li>
	    <li>Hide the menus and toolbar buttons that you don't need in your application.</li>
	    <li>Add a Plugin Manager so that users can install new features at runtime.</li>
	    <li>Localize the application.</li>
	    <li>Customize the display text in the title bar.</li>
	    <li>Customize the splash screen, icons, and NetBeans Platform display texts.</li>
	    <li>Create an installer.</li>
	</ul>

        <h2 class="tutorial"><a name="key"></a>Key Points</h2>

        <p>We now have our POV-Ray rendering application working exactly as we want. During the course
	    of this tutorial, many NetBeans Platform topics have been covered. Here they
	    are listed, per part:</p>

	<ul class="toc">
            <li>Part  1: <a href="nbm-povray-1.html">Application Structure & File Support</a>&#8212;Here
		you learn how to set up a NetBeans Platform application, how to create modules,
		and how the NetBeans Platform distinguishes between different types of files.</li>
            <li>Part  2: <a href="nbm-povray-2.html">Project Type Design</a>&#8212;Before beginning to
		code, you spend some time examining the requirements of the application and how you will
		implement those requirements.</li>
            <li>Part  3: <a href="nbm-povray-3.html">Implementing a Project Type</a>&#8212;Here you learn
		how the NetBeans Platform is able to recognize a set of folders and files on disk as being
		POV-Ray projects. By the end of this section, you're able to open POV-Ray projects into your
		application.</li>
            <li>Part  4: <a href="nbm-povray-4.html">Providing Project Templates</a>&#8212;You install
		your POV-Ray Project module into NetBeans IDE, so that the IDE is able to
		recognize POV-Ray projects. You then create some POV-Ray projects and create
		project template wizards, registering them in the module so that they're
		available to your users via the New Project dialog.</li>
            <li>Part  5: <a href="nbm-povray-5.html">Creating an API</a>&#8212;Here you create a provider
		of main files, a rendering service, and a viewing service. You are shown how to encapsulate
		these interfaces in a separate module, how to load that module on demand, and how to share
		it with the other two modules in the application. A first usage of one of the APIs is
		described&#8212;the <tt>Node</tt> of a POV-Ray file will be bold-faced if the
		main file provider indicates that the <tt>Node</tt> represents the main file of the project.</li>
            <li>Part  6: <a href="nbm-povray-6.html">Implementing the API</a>&#8212;In this section, you
		learn how implement the APIs created in the previous part, you add <tt>Actions</tt> to the <tt>Node</tt>
		for setting the main file and for rendering POV-Ray files, and you add some plumbing code for
		locating the POV-Ray executable.</li>
            <li>Part  7: <a href="nbm-povray-7.html">Support For Running POV-Ray</a>&#8212;For the first time,
		you actually begin working directly with the POV-Ray executable. By the end of this section,
		you're able to actually render POV-Ray files and display the rendered images.</li>
            <li>Part  8: <a href="nbm-povray-8.html">Implementing ViewService and its Actions</a>&#8212;An <tt>Action</tt>
		for opening images, and rendering them if they don't already exist, is added. You're also introduced
		to the topic of icon badging, which you use to distinguish between <tt>Nodes</tt> representing files
		that have been rendered and those that represent files that haven't been rendered.</li>
            <li>Part  9: <a href="nbm-povray-9.html">Build Support</a>&#8212;You now move away from working with the <tt>Node</tt>
		representing POV-Ray files. Instead, you work on the project node and add new project actions, for rendering
		the main file of the POV-Ray project, for setting the main file if it has not been set, and for closing
		the project.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="tutorial"><a name="next"></a>Next Steps</h2>

        <p>Now that you have completed the POV-Ray tutorial, what should
	    you do next?</p>

        <ul>
	    <li>With the concepts you've learned and applied in this tutorial,
		take another look at the <b><a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/NbmIdioms">Introduction
                        to NetBeans Idioms and Infrastructure</a></b>, which reinforces
                a lot of the concepts you have encountered in this tutorial.
	    </li>
            <li>Explore the <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/NetBeansDeveloperFAQ">NetBeans Developer FAQ</a>,
		focusing on the specific topics you're interested in.
	    </li>
            <li>Gain some more practical experiences by joining one
		of the many NetBeans Platform open
		source projects: <a href="http://java.net/projects/netbeans">http://java.net/projects/netbeans</a>
	    </li>
            <li>
		Stay in tune with the latest NetBeans API changes,
		by looking through this page now and again:
		<a href="http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/apichanges.html">http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/apichanges.html</a>
	    </li>
	    <li>As you learn more about the NetBeans Platform, blog about
		your experiences. You can publish or republish your
		blog entries, articles, tips, or any other thoughts
		here on NetBeans Zone: <a href="http://netbeans.dzone.com/">http://netbeans.dzone.com/</a>
		<li>When you have an application ready, ask for it to be
		    added to the <a href="https://platform.netbeans.org/screenshots.html">NetBeans Platform Showcase</a>,
		    which is a great page to look through when beginning your project, since more
		    than likely a similar project that you can learn from, possibly in the open source community,
		    already exists.
		</li>
		<li>Read and work through
		    the <a href="https://platform.netbeans.org/tutorials/nbm-porting-basic.html">NetBeans Platform Porting Tutorial</a> and
		    apply its principles to your own existing applications.</a>
		    </ul>

		    <h2 class="tutorial"><a name="appendix"></a>Appendix: Setting Up POV-Ray</h2>

		    <p>Mac users may find
			<a href="http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/">DarwinPorts</a> the easiest
			wayâ€”simply install DarwinPorts and then run
			<code>sudo port install povray</code>.</p>

		    <p>Linux and other Unix users should be
			fine with the downloads available from <a href="http://povray.org/">povray.org</a>.
			Everything should work out of the box for these users, without any tweaks
			or post-install configurations. Make sure, however, that the POV-Ray
			launcher has the correct permissions, otherwise it will not execute. Run it from
			the command line to check that it executes.</p>

		    <p>Under Windows, life is slightly more complicated. Take
			the following steps to set up POV-Ray:</p>

		    <ol>

			<li>Download the newest stable version of POV-Ray for Windows:
			    <a href="http://povray.org/download">http://povray.org/download</a>
			</li>

			<li><p>Run the downloaded file and install into "C:\POVRay" or some
				other directory, while making sure that the path has no spaces, even
				though the installer will prompt you to install in a directory
				with spaces. For example, change the suggested destination directory to "C:\POVRay",
				as shown here:</p>

			    <p><img alt="" src="../images/tutorials/povray/71/ch10/pov-windows-1.png"/></p>

			    <p class="notes"><b>Note:</b> Do not let the installer install the application
				into the destination directory "C:\Program Files" or into
				any of that directory's subfolders.

			    </p><p class="tips"><b>Note:</b> Read the above note again.

			    </p><p></p></li><li>Open the POV-Ray application. Do the following:

			    <ul>
				<li><p>Disable I/O restrictions to avoid input and output warnings on
					each render: Options | Script I/O Restrictions | No Restrictions.</p>
				    <p><img alt="" src="../images/tutorials/povray/71/ch10/pov-windows-2.png" /></p>
				</li>
				<li><p>To facilitate smooth interoperability with the plugin that
					you will create, ensure that POV-Ray will exit when rendering
					completes: Render | On Completion | Exit POV-Ray for Windows.</p>
				    <p><img alt="" src="../images/tutorials/povray/71/ch10/pov-windows-3.png" /></p>
				</li>
			    </ul>

			</li>

		    </ol>

		    <p class="notes"><b>Note:</b> POV-Ray for Windows cannot process paths with spaces. When
			you use the application that you will create to create POV-Ray projects, make
			sure that you create them in directories without spaces in their paths. The
			name of the project must not have any spaces either.</p>
