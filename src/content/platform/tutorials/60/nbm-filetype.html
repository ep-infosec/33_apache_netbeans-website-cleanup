<h2 class="tutorial"><a name="intro"></a>Introduction to File Type Integration</h2>

<p>File types that are recognized in the IDE have their own icons, menu items, and behavior. 
The "files" being shown are <tt>FileObjects</tt>&#8212;wrappers
around <tt>java.io.File</tt> or, in the case of configuration files, typically wrappers around data stored in some other way, 
such as inside XML files in modules. What you actually <i>see</i> are <tt>Nodes</tt>, which provide functionality like actions
and localized names to objects like files. In between <tt>Nodes</tt> and <tt>FileObjects</tt> are <tt>DataObjects</tt>. 
A <tt>DataObject</tt> is like a <tt>FileObject</tt>, except that it knows what kind of file is being shown, and there are 
usually different types of <tt>DataObject</tt> for files with different extensions and XML files with different namespaces.
Each <tt>DataObject</tt> is provided by a different module, each implementing support for one or more file types&#8212;for example,
the Image module makes it possible to recognize and open <tt>.gif</tt> and <tt>.png</tt> files.

<p>A module that recognizes a file type installs a <tt>DataLoader</tt>&#8212;a factory for a file-type-specific <tt>DataObject</tt>.
When a folder is expanded, the IDE asks each known <tt>DataLoader</tt>, "Do you know what this is?" The first one that says 
"Yes" creates the <tt>DataObject</tt> for the file. In order to actually display something for each file, the system calls 
<tt>DataObject.getNodeDelegate()</tt> for each <tt>DataObject</tt> and the <tt>Nodes</tt> are what you actually see in the IDE. 

<p>Below, the diagram on the left shows what each item mentioned above makes available:

<p><p align="left"><img border="1" src="../../images/tutorials/filetype/diagram-dataobject2.png" alt="Diagram.">

<p>In this tutorial, you create a module that installs a <tt>DataLoader</tt> for imaginary "Abc" files 
(<tt>.abc</tt> file extension). By default, a file with the "abc" extension is treated as any other file that
the IDE does not recognize&#8212;it is treated as a text file and, as a result, the IDE provides the same functionality for
Abc files as it does for text files. Once you have created the module, you will be shown how to enhance it
with functionality that will be available to Abc files only. When you complete the development cycle, you can easily let others make use of
 your module&#8212;the IDE lets you create a binary that you can send to others, who can then install it through the
 Update Center.

<!-- ===================================================================================== -->

<h2 class="tutorial"><a name="creating"></a>Creating the Module Project</h2>
      
<p>In this section, we use a wizard to create the source structure that every NetBeans module requires. The
source structure consists of certain folders in specific places and a set of files that are
always needed. For example, every NetBeans module requires a 'nbproject' folder, which holds
the project's metadata, and a <tt>layer.xml</tt> file, for declarative registration of items
such as toolbar buttons and windows.

<ol>
          
	      <li>Choose File &gt; New Project (Ctrl-Shift-N). Under Categories, select NetBeans Modules. Under projects, 
 select Module and click Next.</li>
	<li>In the Name and Location panel, type <tt>AbcFileType</tt> in Project Name.
 Change the
Project Location to any directory on your computer, such as <tt>c:\mymodules</tt>. Leave the Standalone Module radiobutton
selected. The panel should now look as follows:

<p><p align="left"><img border="1" src="../../images/tutorials/filetype/60-projectwizard1.png" alt="Step 1 of New Project wizard.">
 <p>Click Next.

<li>In the Basic Module Configuration panel, replace <tt>yourorghere</tt> in Code Name Base with <tt>myorg</tt>,
 so that the whole code name base is <tt>org.myorg.abcfiletype</tt>. 
 Add spaces to the default Module Display Name, so that it is changed to <tt>Abc File Type</tt>.
 Leave the location of the localizing bundle and XML layer, so that they will be stored in a
 package with the name <tt>org/myorg/abcfiletype</tt>. The panel should now look as follows:

<p><p align="left"><img border="1" src="../../images/tutorials/filetype/60-projectwizard2.png" alt="Step 2 of New Project wizard.">

<li>Click Finish.</ol>

<p> The IDE creates the <tt>Abc File Type</tt>
project. The project contains all of your sources and
project metadata, such as the project's Ant build script. The project
opens in the IDE. You can view its logical structure in the Projects window (Ctrl-1) and its
file structure in the Files window (Ctrl-2). For example, the Projects window should now look as follows:

<p><p align="left"><img border="1" src="../../images/tutorials/filetype/60-projectswindow1.png" alt="Initial Projects window.">


      <br />

<!-- ===================================================================================== -->
<h2><a name="recognizing"></a>Recognizing Abc Files</h2>

<p>In this section, we use a wizard to create the classes necessary for
 recognizing Abc files as being distinct from all other files. As discussed
 at the start of this tutorial, we need a data object and a data loader, as
 well as a MIME type resolver, and registration entries in the <tt>layer.xml</tt> file,
 to do so. The New File Type wizard will create all of these for us.

  
 <ol>
	
	 <li>Right-click the project node and 
	      choose New &gt; File Type.</li>
	      <li>In the File Recognition panel, do the following:
<p><ul><li>Type <tt>text/x-abc</tt> in the MIME Type edit box.
<li>Type <tt>.abc .ABC</tt> in the by Filename Extension edit box.</ul>
<p>The File Recognition panel should now look as follows:

	       <p><p align="left"><img border="1" src="../../images/tutorials/filetype/60-filewizard1.png" alt="Step 1 of New File wizard.">

	       <p>Note the following about the fields in the File Recognition panel:
	       <ul>
		       <li><b>MIME Type.</b> Specifies the data object's unique MIME type.
		       <li>by
			       <ul><li><b>Filename Extension.</b> Specifies one or more file extensions that the IDE will recognize 
		       as belonging to the specified MIME type. The file extension can optionally be preceded 
		       by a dot. Separators are commas, spaces, or both. Therefore, all of the following are valid:
		       <p><ul><li><tt>.abc,.def</tt>
			       <li><tt>.abc .def</tt>
			       <li><tt>abc def</tt>
			       <li><tt>abc,.def ghi, .wow</ul></tt>
			<p>Let's imagine that Abc files be case-sensitive. For
 this reason, you specify <i>two</i> MIME types in this tutorial&#8212;<tt>.abc</tt> and <tt>.ABC</tt>.		      
		       <li><b>XML Root Element.</b> Specifies a unique namespace that distinguishes the XML file 
		       type from all other XML file types. Since many XML files have the same extension (<tt>xml</tt>),
			 the IDE distinguishes between
		       XML files via their XML root elements. More specifically, the IDE can distinguish between namespaces and
		       the first XML element in XML files. You can use this to, for example, distinguish
		       between a JBoss deployment descriptor and a WebLogic deployment descriptor. Once you have made
		       this distinction, you can ensure that menu items added to the JBoss deployment descriptor's contextual menu
			are not available to the WebLogic deployment descriptor. For an example, see
 the <a href="nbm-palette-api2.html">NetBeans Component Palette Module Tutorial</a>.
	</ul></ul>
	      
	      <p>Click Next.

	      <li>In the Name and Location panel, type <tt>Abc</tt> as the Class Name Prefix
	      and browse to any 16x16 pixel image file as the new file type's icon, as shown below.
	      
<p align="left"><p><p align="left"><img border="1" src="../../images/tutorials/filetype/60-filewizard2.png" alt="Step 2 of New File wizard.">


              <p><b>Note:</b>You can use any icon. If you like, you can
              click on this one and save it locally, and then
              specify it in the wizard step above: <img border="1" src="../../images/tutorials/filetype/Datasource.gif" alt="Datasource.gif">

<li>Click Finish.

<p><p>The Projects window should now look as follows:

<p><p align="left"><img border="1" src="../../images/tutorials/filetype/60-projectswindow2.png" alt="Final Projects window."></ol>

<p>Each of the newly generated files is briefly introduced:
 <ul>
	 <li><b>AbcDataLoader.java.</b> Recognizes the <tt>text/x-abc</tt> MIME type. Functions as a factory for
	 <tt>AbcDataObject.java</tt>. For more information, see <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/wiki/view/Netbeans/DevFaqDataLoader">What is a DataLoader?</a>.
 <li><b>AbcResolver.xml.</b> Maps the <tt>.abc</tt> and <tt>.ABC</tt> extensions to the MIME type. The <tt>AbcDataLoader</tt> only 
 recognizes the MIME type; it does not know about the file extension.
	<li><b>AbcDataObject.java.</b> Wraps a <tt>FileObject</tt>. DataObjects are produced by DataLoaders.
	 For more information, see <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/wiki/view/DevFaqDataObject">What is a DataObject?</a>.
	 <li><b>AbcDataNode.java.</b> Provides what you <i>see</i> in the IDE&#8212;functionality like actions, icons, and localized names.
	 <li><b>AbcDataLoaderBeanInfo.java.</b> Controls the appearance of the loader in the Object Types section
 of the Options window.
</ul>
      </p>


      <br />

<!-- ===================================================================================== -->
<h2><a name="adding"></a>Creating Features for Abc Files</h2>
<p>Now that the NetBeans Platform is able to distinguish Abc files from all other types of files,
it is time to add features specifically for these types of files. In this section, we add a menu
item on the right-click contextual menu of the file's node in the explorer windows, such as in
the Projects window, and we enable the file to open into a window, instead of into an editor.

      <div class="indent">
          
          <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="action"></a>Adding an Action</h3>
          
          <p>In this subsection, we use the New Action wizard to create a Java class that
          will perform an action for our file type. The wizard will also register the class
          in the <tt>layer.xml</tt> file such that the user will be able to invoke the
          action from the right-click contextual menu of the file type's node in an explorer window.
          
          <ol>
              
              <li>Right-click the project node and 
              choose New &gt; Action.</li>
              <li>In the Action Type panel, click Conditionally Enabled. Type <tt>AbcDataObject</tt>, which
              is the name of the data object generated above by the New File Type wizard, as shown below:
              
              <p><p align="left"><img border="1" src="../../images/tutorials/filetype/60-action1.png" alt="Step 1 of New Action wizard.">
              
              
              
              <p>Click Next.
              
              <li>In the GUI Registration panel, select the 'Edit' category in the Category drop-down list.
              The Category drop-down list controls where an action is shown in the Keyboard Shortcuts editor in the IDE.
              <p><p>Next, Unselect Global Menu Item and then select File Type Contect Menu Item.
              In the Content Type drop-down list, select the MIME type you specified above in the New File Type
              wizard, as shown below:
              
              <p align="left"><p><p align="left"><img border="1" src="../../images/tutorials/filetype/60-action2.png" alt="Step 2 of New Action wizard.">
              
              <p>Notice that you can set the position of the menu item and that you
              can separate the menu item from the item before it and after it. Click Next.
              
              <li>In the Name and Location panel, type <tt>MyAction</tt> as the Class Name 
              and type <tt>My Action</tt> as the Display Name. Menu items provided by contextual menus
              do not display icons. Therefore, click Finish and <tt>MyAction.java</tt> is added to the <tt>org.myorg.abcfiletype</tt> package.
              
              <li>In the Source Editor, add some code to the action's <tt>performAction</tt> method:
              
<pre class="examplecode">protected void performAction(Node[] activatedNodes) {
	AbcDataObject d = (AbcDataObject) activatedNodes[0].getCookie(AbcDataObject.class);
	FileObject f = d.getPrimaryFile();
	String displayName = FileUtil.getFileDisplayName(f);
	String msg = "I am " + displayName + ". Hear me roar!"; 
        NotifyDescriptor nd = new NotifyDescriptor.Message(msg);
        DialogDisplayer.getDefault().notify(nd);
}</pre>
              <p>Press Ctrl-Shift-I. The IDE automatically adds import statements to the top of the class. Some code
              is still underlined in red, to indicate that not all of the required packages are on the classpath.
              Right-click the project node, choose Properties, and click Libraries in the Project Properties dialog box.
              Click add at the top of the Libraries pane and add the Dialogs API. 
              <p>In the <tt>MyAction.java</tt> class, press Ctrl-Shift-I again. The red underlining disappears because
              the IDE finds the required packages in the Dialogs API.
              
              <li>In the Important Files node, expand XML Layer. The two nodes <tt>&lt;this layer&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;this layer in context&gt;</tt>,
              together with their subnodes, make up the <a href="https://platform.netbeans.org/tutorials/nbm-glossary.html">System Filesystem</a> Browser. Expand <tt>&lt;this layer&gt;</tt>, expand <tt>Loaders</tt>, 
              continue expanding nodes until you see the <tt>Action</tt> that you created above.
              
              <li>Drag-and-drop <tt>My Action</tt> so that it appears below the <tt>Open</tt> action, as shown below:
              <p align="left"><p><p align="left"><img border="1" src="../../images/tutorials/filetype/60-action3.png" alt="System Filesystem Browser.">
              
              <p>As you can see from the last two steps, the System Filesystem Browser can be used to quickly reorganize
              the sequence of the items that are registered in the System Filesystem.
              
          </ol>
          
          <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="topcomponent"></a>Opening the File into a Window</h3>
          <p>By default, when the user opens a file of the type that we have defined in this tutorial,
          the file will open into a basic editor. However, sometimes you may want to create a visual
          representation of the file, and let the user drag and drop widgets onto the visual representation.
          The first step in creating such a user interface is to let the user open the file into a window.
          This subsection shows you how to do that.
          <ol>
              <li>Use the Window Component wizard
               to create a TopComponent called AbcTopComponent.
              <li>Change the data object to use OpenSupport instead of DataEditorSupport.

<p><pre>public AbcDataObject(FileObject pf, AbcDataLoader loader) 
        throws DataObjectExistsException, IOException {

    super(pf, loader);
    CookieSet cookies = getCookieSet();
    //cookies.add((Node.Cookie) DataEditorSupport.create(this, getPrimaryEntry(), cookies));
    cookies.add((Node.Cookie) new AbcOpenSupport(getPrimaryEntry()));
              
}</pre>
              
              
              <li>Create OpenSupport class:
              
<p><pre>class AbcOpenSupport extends OpenSupport implements OpenCookie, CloseCookie {

    public AbcOpenSupport(AbcDataObject.Entry entry) {
        super(entry);
    }

    protected CloneableTopComponent createCloneableTopComponent() {
        AbcDataObject dobj = (AbcDataObject) entry.getDataObject();
        AbcTopComponent tc = new AbcTopComponent();
        tc.setDisplayName(dobj.getName());
        return tc;
    }
 
}</pre>              
              
              <li>Tweak the TopComponent to extend CloneableTopComponent,
              instead of TopComponent. Set the TopComponent's class modifier, and its 
              constructor's modifier, to public instead
              of private.
          </ol>	
<p>Now, when an Abc file is opened, the OpenSupport class handles the 
 opening, such that it opens the file into the TopComponent instead
 of the basic editor that DataEditorSupport provides.
      The <a href="https://platform.netbeans.org/tutorials/60/nbm-visual_library.html">NetBeans Visual Library 6.0 Tutorial</a>
       provides an example of what you can do
       to develop the TopComponent further.
