        <h1>NetBeans Platform CRUD Tutorial Using Maven</h1>

        <p>This tutorial demonstrates how to use the Maven build framework to create a simple
            NetBeans Platform application that can read from and write to a database.
            In this document you will use Maven archetypes to create the NetBeans Platform application and module,
            and the Swing UI toolkit and "Matisse" GUI Builder to create window components.
        </p>

        <p class="tips">This document is based on the Ant-based <a href="nbm-crud.html">NetBeans Platform CRUD Application Tutorial</a>
            and can be used to understand some of the differences between using Ant and Maven 
            to develop NetBeans Platform applications.
            After you understand how Maven is different from Ant, you can easily proceed through other
            tutorials on the <a href="https://netbeans.org/kb/trails/platform.html">NetBeans Platform Learning Trail</a>.

        <p><strong class="notes">Note:</strong> You do not need to download Maven because it
            is bundled with the IDE. Optionally, use your own download of Maven, in which
            case use the Options window to configure your Maven settings.</p>

        <p class="notes"><b>Note:</b> This is <u>not</u> a beginners tutorial. Before starting this tutorial, it is important that you familiarize yourself with
            the following introductory Maven documentation:</p>

            <h2><a name="00"></a>Creating and Running the Sample Application</h2>

            <p>In this section, you set up a sample application provided by NetBeans IDE.
                The sample application access data and displays data in a Maven-based
                NetBeans Platform application, similar to the application you create
                in this tutorial. Successfully running the sample application and displaying
                data will be useful in determining whether the database connection is set up
                correctly.
            </p>

                        <p class="tips">Once the project is opened, if you see 
                            projects with [unloadable] in the display name, that means

                            up Maven for the first time on their system.</p>
                        <p>If you see the above, wait for the Maven dependencies to download, which is a process
                            that you can follow
                            by looking in the status bar of the IDE. Once the downloading has
                            completed, and not before, right-click each project and choose "Build with Dependencies".

                        <p>The project structure above is explained here:</p>

                                This project is a Maven reactor project for the NetBeans Platform 
                                application, which lists the modules to include and the location 
                                of the project's repositories. This project does not contain any 
                                sources.
                                The IDE generates the modules containing the sources and resources 
                                in sub-directories of this project.
                            </li>
                            <li><img src="../images/tutorials/maven-crud/72/suiteicon.png"/> <strong>NetBeans Platform based application.</strong>
                                The NetBeans Platform application project enumerates included modules; permits interactive runs; 
                                produces various kinds of packaging, such as ZIP by default, but optionally 
                                JNLP, NBMs; holds functional tests. 
                                Each module project specifies its own compile dependencies, while
                                the app project's dependencies are anything additional that should be present at 
                                runtime. For example, that includes, by default, the whole platform cluster, that is,
                                the set of modules constituting the "platform" cluster. The app project could
                                include other clusters, or subsets of clusters, or whatever plugins you want
                                included in your app which are not used as compilation dependencies. At a minimum, 
                                core.startup and its transitive dependencies are included. </li>

                            by connecting to the sample database. Right-click on the connection

                            register an instance of GlassFish that is bundled with the IDE.
                            The JavaDB database server and a sample database are included with 
                            the GlassFish server.</p>

                            notice that the viewer is automatically updated. Changes you make are
                            stored in the database.</p>

                                The NetBeans Platform application project enumerates included modules; permits interactive runs; 
                                produces various kinds of packaging, such as ZIP by default, but optionally 
                                JNLP, NBMs; holds functional tests. 
                                Each module project specifies its own compile dependencies, while
                                the app project's dependencies are anything additional that should be present at 
                                runtime. For example, that includes, by default, the whole platform cluster, that is,
                                the set of modules constituting the "platform" cluster. The app project could
                                include other clusters, or subsets of clusters, or whatever plugins you want
                                included in your app which are not used as compilation dependencies. At a minimum, 
                                core.startup and its transitive dependencies are included. </li>

            <p>In this section you generate Java Persistence API (JPA)

                you need to have access to a database server and the

                                understanding of how developing with
                                Maven is different from Ant. You can easily proceed through other

                                    Platform Learning Trail</a> and apply them to your Maven scenarios.

                                how to use the Maven build framework to create a new NetBeans Platform application with CRUD functionality.
