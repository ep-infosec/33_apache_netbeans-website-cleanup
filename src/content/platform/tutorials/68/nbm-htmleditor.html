    <h1>NetBeans Platform HTML Editor</h1>
   
   <p>This tutorial provides a very simple and quick introduction to 
   the NetBeans Platform workflow by walking you through the creation 
   of a simple HTML Editor. Though simple, the HTML Editor you create
   will be very mature because it will reuse the infrastructure provided
   by the NetBeans Platform. For example, without any coding, your
   HTML Editor will have a mature window system. 
   Once you are done with this tutorial, you 
   will have a general understanding of how to create, build, and run 
   applications on top of the NetBeans Platform.</p>
   
   <p>After you finish this tutorial, you can move on to the 
   <a href="https://netbeans.org/kb/trails/platform.html">NetBeans Platform learning trail</a>.
   The learning trail provides comprehensive tutorials 
   that highlight a wide range of NetBeans APIs for a variety of application types. 
   If you do not want to do a "Hello World" application, you can skip this 
   tutorial and jump straight to the learning trail.</p>
   
      <p><b class="notes">Note:</b> This document uses the NetBeans IDE 6.7 Release. If you
    are using an earlier version, see <a href="61/nbm-htmleditor.html">the 6.1 version
    of this document</a>.
      If this is your first encounter with the NetBeans Platform,
      you are recommended to work through the <a href="nbm-quick-start.html">NetBeans Platform Quick Start</a> before
      continuing with this one. If, instead of learning how to create a NetBeans Platform
      application, you would like to learn how to create a NetBeans plugin,

<p>At the end of this tutorial, you will have an 
    HTML Editor that looks like this:</p>

   <p><img src="../images/tutorials/htmleditor/html-editor-65.png" alt="Final HTML Editor"/></p>
  
    <p><b class="notes">Note:</b> Although this a very simple demo application, it is not a toy! It is a <i>real</i>
    program that supports easy editing of HTML pages, with features such as code completion,
    validation, and predefined HTML snippets.</p>
    
    <p>The HTML Editor that you create in this tutorial is a rich-client application built "on top of the NetBeans Platform". What this
    means is that the core of the IDE, which is what the NetBeans Platform <i>is</i>, will be the base
    of your application. On top of the NetBeans Platform, you add the modules that you need
    and exclude the ones that the IDE needs but that your application doesn't.
    Here you see some of the IDE's modules, added to the NetBeans Platform, which is its base:</p>
    
   <p><img src="../images/tutorials/htmleditor/diagram.png" alt="Structure of NetBeans Platform applications"/></p>
    
    <p>Creating this HTML Editor means generating an application skeleton, excluding the modules
        and user interface items that you do not need, and then setting the Favorites window
        as the window that will open by default when the IDE starts. All of these activities
    are supported by user interface elements in the IDE. </p>
    
    <p>You will see for yourself how simple
        and easy it is to build, or to be more precise, to <em>assemble</em> a
        full-featured application on top of the NetBeans Platform. At the end, you are shown how
        to make the final product easily downloadable and launchable using WebStart.
    </p>
    
    
    <p><b class="notes">Note:</b> Even though it is a separate product, there is no need to download the NetBeans Platform separately
    for purposes of this tutorial. You will develop the rich-client application in the IDE and then exclude the modules
    that are specific to the IDE but that are superfluous to you application.</p>
    
    <!-- ===================================================================================== -->
 
    <h2 class="tutorial"><a name="generating"></a>Generating the Skeleton Application</h2>
    
            <p>When creating an application on the NetBeans Platform,
                the very first step is to create a NetBeans Platform Application project.
                The default NetBeans Platform Application project includes <i>all</i> the modules
                included in the NetBeans Platform as well as <i>all</i> the
                modules included in NetBeans IDE. Since we do not need all
                these modules, we will exclude those that we do not need.</p>
                
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Using the New Project wizard (Ctrl-Shift-N), create a NetBeans Platform Application Project from the template
                in 
                the NetBeans modules category, as shown below:
        
                <p><img src="../images/tutorials/htmleditor/new-nb-app-wiz-65.png" alt="New Project wizard"/></p>
        
        
            <p>Click Next and name the NetBeans Platform Application project "NetBeansHTMLEditor".
                Click Finish.</p></li>

            <li>Right-click the project node, choose Properties,
        and then make a few changes in the NetBeans Platform Application's Project Properties
        dialog box:
        <ul><li>In the Build panel, make sure that the
                "Create Standalone Application" radiobutton is
                clicked, to specify that this
                is going to be a rich-client application
            on top of the NetBeans Platform.
            
                 <p>Make sure
                that you like the branding name for the executable 
                and tweak the application title for the titlebar,
            as shown below:</p>
            
            <img src="../images/tutorials/htmleditor/html-editor-prop-1-65.png" alt="Application panel"/></li>
                <li>In the Splash Screen panel, notice that
                you can provide the application's splash screen, and progress
                bar brandings, as shown below:
            
            
            <img src="../images/tutorials/htmleditor/html-editor-prop-2-65.png" alt="Splash Screen panel"/>
            
            <p><b class="notes">Note:</b> If you do not have a splash screen, use <a href="../images/tutorials/htmleditor/splash.gif">this one</a></p>.
                </li></ul></li>
        <li>In the Libraries panel of the Project Properties
        dialog box, you see a list of "clusters". A cluster is
        a collection of related modules. The only clusters that need to be 
        selected are <tt>ide11</tt> and <tt>platform11</tt>, as shown below:

        <p><img src="../images/tutorials/htmleditor/libraries-cust-1.png" alt="Application panel"/></p>

         <p>Next, click the "Resolve" button and the required modules
              will be added to the set of modules needed by
              modules that you have already selected to be
              part of the application. The "Resolve" button disappears
         and no red error messages should remain:</p>
        <p><img src="../images/tutorials/htmleditor/libraries-cust-2.png" alt="Application panel"/></p>
        </li>
    </ol>
  
    <p>Now you have the subset of NetBeans modules that are relevant to your HTML Editor.
    However, even though you need the modules that you now have, you probably do not
    need all of the user interface elements that these modules give you. In the next sections,
    you tweak the user interface and customize the window layout specifically for the HTML Editor
    that you are creating.</p>
<!-- ===================================================================================== -->
    
    <h2 class="tutorial"><a name="tweakingthemenuitems"></a>Tweaking the User Interface</h2>
    
        <p>You can keep or reject as much of the user interface that your selected modules give you. For example, your HTML Editor probably
            does not need any or all of the items under the Tools menu. Similarly, maybe there are toolbars
            or toolbar buttons that you can do without. In this section, you prune the IDE's user interface
            until you are left with a subset that is useful to your specific rich-client application.</p>
            
            <ol><li>Expand the NetBeans Platform Application project, right-click the Modules node
        and choose Add New, as shown below:
        
    <p><img src="../images/tutorials/htmleditor/add-module-61.png" alt="This layer in context"/></p>
        
        <p>The New Project wizard (Ctrl-Shift-N) appears.
            Name the project <tt>BrandingModule</tt>, click Next.</p></li>
        
                <li>In the Code Name Base field, type <tt>org.netbeans.brandingmodule</tt>.</li>
        <li>Click "Generate XML Layer" and then
            click Finish.</li>
        <li>In the branding module, expand the <tt>layer.xml</tt> node. 
            Two subnodes are exposed:
        
            <p><img src="../images/tutorials/htmleditor/expanded-xml-layer-61.png" alt="Expanded XML layer file"/></p></li>
        
        <li>In the <tt>&lt;this layer in context&gt;</tt> node,
            the IDE shows you a merged view of all folders and files that all modules register in their
        layers. To exclude items, you can right-click them and choose 'Delete', as shown below:
        
        <p><img src="../images/tutorials/htmleditor/this-layer-in-context-61.png" alt="This layer in context"/></p>
        
        <p>The IDE then adds
        tags to the module's <tt>layer.xml</tt> file which, when the module is installed,
        hides the items that you have deleted. For example, by right-clicking within <tt>Menu Bar/Edit</tt>, you can remove
        menu items from the Edit menu that are not necessary for the HTML Editor. 
        By doing this, you generate snippets such as the following in the <tt>layer.xml</tt> file:</p>
        
        <pre class="examplecode">&lt;folder name="Menu"&gt;
    &lt;folder name="Edit"&gt;
        &lt;file name="org-netbeans-modules-editor-MainMenuAction$StartMacroRecordingAction.instance_hidden"/&gt;
        &lt;file name="org-netbeans-modules-editor-MainMenuAction$StopMacroRecordingAction.instance_hidden"/&gt;
    &lt;/folder&gt;       
&lt;/folder&gt;</pre>
        
        <p>
        The result of the above snippet is that the <tt>Start Macro Recording</tt> and <tt>Stop Macro Recording</tt>
        actions provided by another module are removed from the menu by your branding module.
        To show them again, simply delete the tags above from the <tt>layer.xml</tt> file.</p></li>
        <li>Use the approach described in the previous step to hide as many toolbars, toolbar buttons,
        menus, and menu items as you want. When you have completed this stage, look in the <tt>layer.xml</tt> file. When you do so,
        you should see something similar to the following, depending on the items that you have deleted:
        
<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE filesystem PUBLIC "-//NetBeans//DTD Filesystem 1.1//EN" "https://netbeans.org/dtds/filesystem-1_1.dtd"&gt;
&lt;filesystem&gt;
    &lt;folder name="Menu"&gt;
        &lt;file name="BuildProject_hidden"/&gt;
        &lt;folder name="File"&gt;
            &lt;file name="Separator2.instance_hidden"/&gt;
            &lt;file name="SeparatorNew.instance_hidden"/&gt;
            &lt;file name="SeparatorOpen.instance_hidden"/&gt;
            &lt;file name="org-netbeans-modules-project-ui-CloseProject.shadow_hidden"/&gt;
            &lt;file name="org-netbeans-modules-project-ui-CustomizeProject.shadow_hidden"/&gt;
            &lt;file name="org-netbeans-modules-project-ui-NewFile.shadow_hidden"/&gt;
            &lt;file name="org-netbeans-modules-project-ui-NewProject.shadow_hidden"/&gt;

            &lt;file name="org-netbeans-modules-project-ui-SetMainProject.shadow_hidden"/&gt;
            &lt;file name="org-netbeans-modules-project-ui-groups-GroupsMenu.shadow_hidden"/&gt;
        &lt;/folder&gt;
        &lt;file name="Refactoring_hidden"/&gt;
        &lt;file name="RunProject_hidden"/&gt;
        &lt;folder name="Window"&gt;

            &lt;file name="org-netbeans-modules-project-ui-physical-tab-action.shadow_hidden"/&gt;
        &lt;/folder&gt;
    &lt;/folder&gt;
&lt;/filesystem&gt;</pre>
</li>
        </ol>
        
<!-- ===================================================================================== -->        
        
        <h2 class="tutorial"><a name="tweakingthewindowlayout"></a>Tweaking the Window Layout</h2>
        <p>
            By using the  <tt>&lt;this layer in context&gt;</tt> node, you can not only delete existing
            items, but you can also change their content. For example, the
            HTML Editor works on HTML files, so in contrast to the regular IDE, which works with Java source files and projects as well,
            it makes sense to show the <tt>Favorites</tt> window in the initial layout.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The definition of the window layout is also described as files in layers,
            all stored under the <tt>Windows2</tt> folder. The files in the <tt>Windows2</tt> folder are
            pseudo-human readable XML files defined by the 
            <a href="http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-windows/org/openide/windows/doc-files/api.html">
            Window System APIs</a>. They are quite complex but the good news is
            that, for purposes of our HTML Editor, it is not necessary
            to understand them fully, as shown below.
        </p>
        
        <ol><li>In your branding module's <tt>&lt;this layer in context&gt;</tt> node,
        look in <tt>Windows2/Components</tt> and <tt>Windows2/Modes</tt> for
        the two files highlighted below and named "favorites.settings" and "favorites.wstcref":

        <p><img src="../images/tutorials/htmleditor/find-favorites2-61.png" alt="Finding the Favorites window"/></p>
    
    <p>
        The first file defines what the component is going to look like and 
        how it gets created. As this does not need to be changed, there is no need to
        modify the file. The second is more interesting for your purposes, 
        it contains the following:
    </p>
    <pre class="examplecode">
&lt;tc-ref version="2.0"&gt;
    &lt;module name="org.netbeans.modules.favorites/1" spec="1.1" /&gt;
    &lt;tc-id id="favorites" /&gt;
    &lt;state opened="false" /&gt;
&lt;/tc-ref&gt;</pre>    
    </li>
    <li>Even though most of the XML is cryptic, there is one line which 
    seems promising&#8212;without needing to read 
    any kind of documentation, it seems likely that
    changing the <tt>false</tt> to <tt>true</tt> is going to make the component
    opened by default. Do so now.</li>
    
    <li>
    In a similar way you can change the <tt>CommonPalette.wstcref</tt>
    file so that the Component Palete opens by default.</li>
        </ol>
    
     
        <p>You should now see that your branding module contains a new file,
            one for each of the files that you changed. In effect, these files
            override the ones that you found in the previous steps. These have
         been automatically registered in your module's <tt>layer.xml</tt> file.</p>

<!-- ===================================================================================== -->     
     
        <h2 class="tutorial"><a name="tweakingthefavorites"></a>Tweaking the Favorites Window</h2>
        <p>
            In the subfolders of a NetBeans Platform Application project's <tt>branding</tt> folder, which
            is visible in the Files window, you
            can override strings defined in the NetBeans sources. In
            this section, you will override strings that define
            labels used in the Favorites window. For example, we
            will change the "Favorites" label to "HTML Files",
            because we will use that window specifically for
            HTML files.
        </p>
        
        <ol><li>Open the Files window and
                expand the NetBeans Platform Application project's <tt>branding</tt> folder.</li>
            <li>Create a new folder structure within <tt>branding/modules</tt>.
                (In the IDE, you can create folders
                by right-clicking a folder and then
                choosing New | Other and then choosing Folder from the Other category.)
                The new folder should be named <tt>org-netbeans-modules-favorites.jar</tt>.
                Within that folder, create a folder hierarchy
                of <tt>org/netbeans/modules/favorites</tt>. Within the final folder,
                i.e. <tt>favorites</tt>, create a new <tt>Bundle.properties</tt> file:
                <p><img src="../images/tutorials/htmleditor/favorites-branding-61a.png" alt="Branding the Favorites window"/></p>

                <p>This folder structure and properties file matches the 
                folder structure in the NetBeans sources that relate to
                the Favorites window.</p></li>
            <li>Add the strings shown in the screenshot below,
             to override the same strings defined in the matching
             properties file in the Favorites window sources:
             
             <p><img src="../images/tutorials/htmleditor/favorites-branding-61b.png" alt="Branding the Favorites window"/></p>
     
                <p>To simplify this step, copy and paste the strings defined above:</p>
            
<pre>Favorites=HTML Files
ACT_AddOnFavoritesNode=&Find HTML Files...
ACT_Remove=&Remove from HTML Files List
ACT_View=HTML Files
ACT_Select=HTML Files
ACT_Select_Main_Menu=Select in HTML Files List

# JFileChooser
CTL_DialogTitle=Add to HTML Files List
CTL_ApproveButtonText=Add
ERR_FileDoesNotExist={0} does not exist.
ERR_FileDoesNotExistDlgTitle=Add to HTML Files List
MSG_NodeNotFound=The document node could not be found in the HTML Files List.</pre></li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Later, when you start up the application, you will see that
             the texts and labels in the Favorites window have changed
             to those listed above. This illustrates that you can take
             a component from the NetBeans Platform and then brand it to
             match your needs.</p>

        <h2 class="tutorial"><a name="runningtheapplication"></a>Running the Application</h2>
        <p>
            Running your application is as simple
            as right-clicking the project node
            and choosing a menu item.
        </p>
        
        <ol>
        <li>Right-click the application's project node and
            choose Clean and Build All.</li>
        <li>Right-click the application's project node and
            choose Run.</li>
            <li>After the application is deployed, you can right-click
                inside the Favorites window and choose a folder containing
            HTML files, and then open an HTML file, as shown below:
        
            <p><img src="../images/tutorials/htmleditor/html-editor-65.png" alt="Open HTML file"/></p></li>
    </ol>
            <p>You now have a complete, functioning, HTML Editor, which you
                created without typing a single line of Java code.</p>
        
        <!-- ===================================================================================== -->

        <h2 class="tutorial"><a name="distributingtheapplication"></a>Distributing the Application</h2>
        <p>
            Choose one of two approaches for distributing
            your application. If you want to maintain as much
            control over your application as possible, you will
            use web start (JNLP) to distribute your application over the web.
            In this scenario, whenever you want to update the application,
            you will do so locally and let your end users know about the
            update, which they will automatically have available next time
            they start up your application over the web. Alternatively, 
            distribute a ZIP file containing your application. The end users
            will then have the complete application locally available. You would
            then distribute updates and new features via the update mechanism,
            described below.</p>
            
            
        <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="zip"></a>Distributing the Application via a ZIP File</h3>
            <p> To make your application extendable, you need to let your
            users install modules to enhance the application's
            functionality. To do so, your application is already bundling the Plugin Manager.
        </p>
        
        
        <ol>
    <li>Choose the Tools | Plugins menu item and install
     some plugins that are useful to your HTML Editor.
        Browse the <a href="http://plugins.netbeans.org/PluginPortal/">Plugin Portal</a>
         to find some suitable ones. This is also how your end users will update their
         local installation of your application.</li>
            
            <li>Right-click the application's project node and
                choose Build ZIP Distribution.</li>
             

            
            <li>In the <tt>dist</tt> folder (visible in the
            Files window), you should now be able to see
            a ZIP file that you can expand, to see its
            contents:
            
            <p><img src="../images/tutorials/htmleditor/unzipped-app-61.png" alt="Generated ZIP file"/></p>
            
            <p><b class="notes">Note:</b> The application's launcher is created in
                the <tt>bin</tt> folder, as shown above.</p></li>
        </ol>

<h3><a name="webstart"></a>Distributing the HTML Editor via the Shared NetBeans Web Start Repository</h3>



  <p>
  Instead of distributing a ZIP file, let's prepare for
   a webstart distribution by finetuning the <tt>master.jnlp</tt> file that is
  generated the first time you start the application via "Run JNLP Application". Even though it does the job, it
   is not yet ready for distribution. At the very least, you need to change the
   information section to provide better descriptions and icons.</p>
    
    <p>
    Another change to the standard JNLP infrastructure is the use of a 
    shared JNLP repository on www.netbeans.org. By default, the JNLP application
    generated for a suite always contains all its modules as well as all the modules it depends on.
    This may be useful for intranet usage, but it is a bit less practical for
    wide internet use. When on the internet, it is much better if all the 
    applications built on the NetBeans Platform refer to one repository of
    NetBeans modules, which means that such modules are shared and 
    do not need to be downloaded 
    more than once.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    There is such a repository for NetBeans 6.1. It does not contain all
    the modules that NetBeans IDE has, but
    it contains enough to make non-IDE applications like our HTML Editor
    possible.
      To use the repository you only need to modify <tt>platform.properties</tt>
    by adding the correct URL:
    </p>
<pre class="examplecode">
# share the libraries from common repository on netbeans.org
# this URL is for release65 JNLP files:
jnlp.platform.codebase=http://bits.netbeans.org/6.5/jnlp/
</pre>    
    <p>
    As soon as the application is started as a JNLP application, all its shared plug-in modules
    are going to be loaded from netbeans.org and shared with other
    applications doing the same.</p>
