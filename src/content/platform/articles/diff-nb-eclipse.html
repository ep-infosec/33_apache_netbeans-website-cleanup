        <h1>What's the Difference between NetBeans Platform and Eclipse RCP?</h1>

        <p>When looking for a rich-client platform as the basis of your applications,
            you will find that there are only two to choose from&#8212;the NetBeans
            Platform and Eclipse RCP.
        <p>The NetBeans Platform and Eclipse RCP are more similar than they
            are different. Both provide a framework for desktop application
            developers. In both cases, a large number of features are provided
            out of the box, from a docking framework, to an action system,
            to update facilities, <a href="https://platform.netbeans.org/description.html">and much more besides</a>. In both cases, a rich
            set of <a href="http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/index.html">APIs</a> are provided, accompanied by many <a href="https://netbeans.org/kb/trails/platform.html">tutorials</a>,
            <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/NetBeansDeveloperFAQ">FAQs</a>, and several <a href="https://platform.netbeans.org/articles/books.html">books</a>.

        <p>However, there <i><u>are</u></i> some very significant differences that
            you need to be aware of when choosing between them.

        <p><b>Details</b>
        <p>Below follow more details on each of the points in the table above.
        <ul>

            <li><p><b>UI Toolkit.</b> When you use the NetBeans Platform, you
                    will be programming with the official standard UI toolkit, which
                    is Swing. Eclipse RCP, on the other hand, makes use of SWT instead.
                    There are many advantages in using Swing instead of SWT. For example,
                    there are thousands of 3rd party libraries available in Swing, which
                    means that they are very easy to integrate into NetBeans Platform
                    applications. SWT does not have that kind of wideranging support
                    and therefore you will have far less 3rd party libraries to choose
                    from. An example is in the area of UI testing: while Swing has Jemmy
                    and similar tools, there are no great equivalents for SWT. In
                    addition, SWT requires that native libraries be included with
                    the end product, for each platform to which you deploy.
                </p>

                <p>Thanks to Swing's look & feel support, you can completely customize
                    the appearance of your application, so that it is totally unique
                    and doesn't resemble any other application on the NetBeans Platform:
                <p><img src="https://netbeans.org/images_www/screenshots/platform/blueMarine_thumb.png"/>
                <p>Many other screenshots of NetBeans Platform
                    applications can be found <a href="https://platform.netbeans.org/screenshots.html">here</a>.

            <li><b>UI Design.</b> The award winning Matisse GUI Builder is
                a standard part of NetBeans IDE. You can use it when prototyping
                and designing your applications on top of the NetBeans Platform.
                Its drag-and-drop capabilities and point-and-click features
                make this an ideal environment for UI design. Many NetBeans Platform
                users have cited this feature, together with the support for
                Swing, as their main reasons for choosing the NetBeans Platform.
                Eclipse RCP has
                a similar tool, based on the Matisse GUI Builder, although it
                is not free.

            <li><b>Module System.</b> Both NetBeans Platform and
                the Eclipse RCP makes use of the <i>de facto</i>
                standard module system, which is OSGi. In addition,
                the NetBeans Platform provides its own module system, based
                the standard Java approach to modularity,
                relying on an extension to the JDK 6 ServiceLoader class for
                intermodular communication.

            <li><b>Build System.</b> A feature specific to the NetBeans Platform
                is the fact that its build system is based on Ant. Ant is
                a standard, non-vendor specific build tool. As a result, you
                are not locked into NetBeans IDE but can, instead, use the
                command line to build your NetBeans Platform applications.
                In fact, you can build NetBeans Platform applications out of the box
                with Ant, and also fairly easily with Maven.

            <li><b>NetBeans Platform in the JDK.</b> Since JDK 6 Update 7,
                many of the JARs that make up the NetBeans Platform are part of the JDK.
                The JARs need to be there because Java VisualVM, the new JDK tool,
                is created on top of the NetBeans Platform. When building your
                application on top of the NetBeans Platform, this fact
                can be useful, both
                for development and delivery purposes.

            <li><b>Free Training.</b> The NetBeans team offers free <a href="http://edu.netbeans.org/courses/nbplatform-certified-training/">NetBeans
                Platform certification</a> to universities, colleges, and schools, as well as
                non-commercial institutions in general. (Write to users@edu.netbeans.org
                if you are interested.) A customized version of this course
                is available to companies, at a standard price. Eclipse RCP
                does not offer free trainings of this kind.
