    <p>Emilian Bold from Romania has been using NetBeans IDE and
    the NetBeans Platform for many years. Recently he ported a
    Swing application to the NetBeans Platform. Here, he shares
    his general experiences with NetBeans, as well as some 
    pleasant discoveries made while porting his application. He
    also talks about <a href="https://netbeans.org/download/dev/javadoc/">
    NetBeans Javadoc</a> and how useful he has found it while
    using the NetBeans APIs.</p>
    
    <p><h3>Emilian... where in the world are you and what do you 
    do there?</h3>
        
    <p>Hi! I live in Timisoara, Romania. (Click <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=timisoara,+romania&ie=UTF8&ll=45.756385,21.211681&spn=0.013145,0.043259&t=h&om=1">here</a>
    for directions!) I work fulltime
    as a Java programmer for Alcatel Timisoara and
    I freelance once in a while. 
        
    <p><h3>Are you active in the Java community there?</h3>
        
    <p>Sadly, there is no vibrant Java community in Timisoara. 
    There are lots of people programming in Java, to my knowledge, 
    both Java ME and Java EE, but we don't have anything formal, 
    like a Java User Group (JUG).

    <p>I've talked to some people that have been planning to start a 
    JUG (more on the Java EE side) but I don't think it is wise to 
    make an estimate of when that will happen right now. It will 
    probably happen in the next year, with some investment from a
    startup. 
        
    <p><h3>How did you first get acquainted with NetBeans IDE?</h3>
        
    <p>It's actually quite a funny story. Initially I had a really 
    lousy PC and, because I had learned Java from some certification
    books I found at our university's library, I used Notepad with 
    <tt>javac</tt> and after that <tt>JCreator</tt> for a
    while.

    <p>I later managed to get a "smuggled" copy of NetBeans on a CD 
    from some older guys working in a small startup. It was amazing. 
    I had no idea what "Bean Patterns" did but it was very nice... 
    and very slow on my PC. This is how I found out about the modular
    structure of NetBeans, the fact that you can disable modules to
    free some RAM, and thus I learned about the NetBeans Platform. 

    <p><h3>And what about the NetBeans Platform? How did you get 
    started with that and why?</h3>

    <p>Initially the NetBeans Platform represented, to me, the core of NetBeans
    that allowed me to "disable" the other memory hungry modules...

    <p>However, since it was open-sourced, I started reading about it
    and got to the Javadoc files. Those files are the lesser known 
    hidden gems in the docs! As a trainee, I started printing the 
    Javadoc HTML files one by one for each API... Nodes... Actions... 
    etc... For example, these ones are good:
    
    <p><ul>
        <li><a href="https://netbeans.org/download/dev/javadoc/org-openide-modules/org/openide/modules/doc-files/api.html">Modules API</a>
        <li><a href="https://netbeans.org/download/dev/javadoc/org-openide-modules/org/openide/modules/doc-files/api.html">Utilities API</a>
        <li><a href="https://netbeans.org/download/dev/javadoc/org-openide-nodes/org/openide/nodes/doc-files/api.html">Nodes API</a>
        <li><a href="https://netbeans.org/download/dev/javadoc/org-openide-windows/org/openide/windows/doc-files/api.html ">Window System API</a>
    </ul>

    <p>I like the idea of having everything pluggable, with 
    dependecies among modules and integrated into a single tool. 
    
    <p>My first project was a report generator on top of the 
    Platform, the 3.6 release. After that, I skipped the 4.x release
    and then returned with NetBeans 5.0. There is a huge difference 
    between the two. 5.0, and above, is much more friendly towards
    module developers. It took me days years ago to do and learn 
    something that is automatically generated now with a simple wizard.
    
    <p><h3>What are some of the things you've done with the 
    NetBeans Platform?</h3>
    
    <p>One thing I did was... port a Swing application to the 
    NetBeans Platform! It is an image processing application. 
    Here is a screenshot of the ported application on the
    NetBeans Platform:
    
    <p><img border="1" align="center" src="nbm_interviews/emilian/gimage.png" alt="gimage">
        
    <p><h3>What's the story behind this application?</h3>
        
    <p>Well, during my re-introduction to 5.0, I needed a simple project
    to play with. So I took a project I did with my
    fellow student Mihaela Gander during
    my university studies. Together, we had built an image processing 
    application. Now, to reacquaint myself with the NetBeans Platform,
    I tried to port it over to the NetBeans Platform.

   
    
    <p>It's not actually finished yet, since I want to give it to my
    students to be enhanced further when school starts at the
    university in October. I'll teach a class or two there, about Java,
    and hopefully pitch the NetBeans Platform. 

    <div style="float: right;"><img src="nbm_interviews/emilian/quote2.png" alt="quote 2"></div>
    
    <p>By the way, the fact that the
    NetBeans Platform is modular makes it excellent
    for this kind of job&#8212;each student or pair may do their
    own module and at the end you get a full application with lots
    of independent modules for different image operations.

    <p><h3>How was it to port the application to the NetBeans Platform?</h3>
    
    <p>Well, the porting was quite easy&#8212;I had 
    a JDesktop with some
    JInternalFrames and I already had a home-made way of defining 
    actions with their own place in the menu etc, which is
    a "poor man's platform", so to speak. So all I had to do was
    convert JInternalFrame to TopComponent
    and then use the NetBeans IDE wizards for the Actions.

    <p>I took the easy way with a CallableSystemAction since there
    are only two kinds of TopComponents&#8212;image or 
    histogram&#8212;but I would like to replace them with proper 
    CookieActions.

    <p>Other than that, since it was pure Swing, nothing had to be 
    altered. I'm now using the <tt>META-INF/services</tt> to allow 
    outside modules to implement new operations and then rely on 
    the Lookup.

    <p>Hopefully it will become a good teaching tool&#8212;with the
    new scripting engines in JDK 6, students could make small scripts
    to test the newly learned filters, etc. The scripting part is 
    not implemented yet, hopefully it will be done by October.

    <p>And the new full screen mode really comes in handy for images!
 
    <p><h3>Have you done anything else with the NetBeans Platform?</h3>

    <p>The current project I'm slowly working on is a mind mapping
    application, using the great <a href="http://graph.netbeans.org/">
    NetBeans Visual Library</a>. Here's what the application looks
    like right now:
    
    <p><img border="1" align="center" src="nbm_interviews/emilian/eMind.png" alt="emind">
        
    <p><h3>What is mind mapping and how does it relate to this 
    application?</h3>
        
    <p>Mind mapping is just a simple way to present ideas by using
    links between notions or words, using different colors, icons, 
    node sizes and shapes (go 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_mapping">here</a> for
    details).

    <p>Basically, I'm planning to heavily use the
    <a href="http://graph.netbeans.org/">NetBeans Visual Library</a>, 
    but currently David Kaspar, the NetBeans engineer responsible for this
    library, is still working on it, especially 
    the Javadoc side. So, I'm just going to wait a little. My code 
    uses pieces from the examples, so there isn't much worthy or
    actually not that much that is mine or original. I use pieces 
    from the examples while waiting for some
    docs or tutorial to learn more about how I can customize 
    the display of the nodes or links, to make them look better. 
        
    <p><h3>What do you enjoy about using the NetBeans Platform?</h3>
        
    <p>I enjoy the fact that everything is already 
    made&#8212;menu items that enable/disable, toolbar buttons, 
    modules that can be updated from the web. For me, once a 
    desktop application gets an (auto)update
    feature, it's in a whole other segment.
    <div style="float: right;"><img src="nbm_interviews/emilian/quote3.png" alt="quote 3"></div>
    <p>There is so much useful code there that it would have 
    taken ages to write it yourself. Of course, that also means 
    learning the APIs... 
    
    <p>By the way, I'm also a fan of dismantling
    NetBeans! Lots of good code there, with no need
    to be tied to a
    particular platform or framework. For example, 
    I've extracted the Progress API to a standalone version and
    open sourced it at <a href="http://progress-api.dev.java.net">progress-api.dev.java.net</a>. 
    I'm also glad someone extracted the
    Window system. Something else: <tt>org-openide-util.jar</tt>
    is also great with the Lookup in standalone applications.</p>
        
    <p><h3>What are some of the problems you encountered while working
    with NetBeans IDE or the NetBeans Platform?</h3>
        
    <p>On the IDE side, I struggled a lot initially with my weak 
    PC and the fact that NetBeans was quite heavy for the RAM. 
    This looks like peanuts now, with 2GB RAM on my laptop,
    but for lesser PCs, it's tough. Thinking back now, I think it
    was wise not to dumb-down the IDE just the make it faster. The
    feature list is impressive and the design
    excellent, so some CPU cycles don't matter, in retrospect.

    <p>On the NetBeans Platform side, 3.6 was quite hard to program even if
there was a freely-downloadable book written with 3.5 in mind. Of
course, that 3.6 made most of the examples unusable.
        
    <p><h3>How did you solve these problems?</h3>
        
    <p>Regarding NetBeans IDE, I just saved some money and bought a 
    new PC...

    <p>For the NetBeans Platform, I've read many times the 
    Javadoc (damn that unfortunate "cookie" word!) and then the
    book. In the end, it started making sense and I could read the
    Javadoc with some ease. But I still learn new things as I read 
    the mailing list or a new tutorial. 
     
    <p><h3>Can you share some code snippets? Maybe some tips and tricks
    of the APIs you've been working with? </h3>
        
    <p>Well, a little thing I've blogged about
    (<a href="http://emilian-bold.blogspot.com/2006/08/netbeans-platform-statuslineelementpro.html">here</a>)
    is how to add your own status bar component in a NetBeans Platform application with the
    help of <tt>StatusLineElementProvider</tt>. Basically, you just create the
    <tt>META-INF/services</tt> folders in the <tt>src/</tt> folder and add the
    <tt>org.openide.awt.StatusLineElementProvider</tt> file with the name of your
    implementing class.

    <p>Next, in your implementing class you just need to implement the
    <tt>StatusLineElementProvider</tt> interface and return your Component in
    <tt>getStatusLineElement()</tt>. It's easy as hell with a trick&#8212;how do you
    determine the order of the items in the statusbar? Well, you rely on the
    Lookup (described <a href="https://netbeans.org/download/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util/org/openide/util/doc-files/api.html#service-lookup">here</a>),
    via the <tt>#position</tt> enhancement.

    <p>Basically, the file will contain first your class and then a numeric position:

    <p><pre class="examplecode">com.example.program.YourClass
#position=SomeNumber</pre>

    <p>And then the NetBeans Platform will add components to the status bar/line starting
    with the smallest number. Just keep in mind that the Progress API has
    a component with position <tt>-13</tt> so usually you would use a smaller
    (that is, negative) number. 

    <p><h3>Other tips?</h3>
    
    <p>Well, this made me smile recently: How do you get rid of the build
    number from a NetBeans Platform application's titlebar? Normally that 
    is a branding operation. So you would go to
    <tt>org-netbeans-core-windows.jar</tt> in the module suite's
    <tt>branding</tt> folder, edit the <tt>Bundle.properties</tt> file and play
    with <tt>CTL_MainWindow_Title</tt> and <tt>CTL_MainWindow_Title_No_Project</tt>.

    <p>However, I recently read about another solution&#8212;in your module installer's
    <tt>restored()</tt> method, just put something like this:
    
    <p><pre class="examplecode">System.setProperty("netbeans.buildnumber", "")</pre>
 
    <p>This works! (Unless the user disables your module...) This shows that 
    sometimes there is more than one way to do the
    branding. However, the person that discovered this trick must surely have grep-ed the source code
    to discover it. Go open source!</p>
    
    <p><h3>Anything else?</h3>
    
    <p>A nice thing about the Options Dialog API is that it allows invalid
        states via the <a href="https://netbeans.org/download/dev/javadoc/org-netbeans-modules-options-api/org/netbeans/spi/options/OptionsPanelController.html#isValid()">isValid</a>
        method. This is a great way to signal to the user that something
        isn't filled correctly. And the NetBeans Platform helps, by disabling the OK button
        and providing only the Cancel. As soon as the Option panel gets into a
        stable state, and isValid() returns true, the OK button is enabled again.

        <p>If you use the Options Panel wizard, you basically have to call
        <tt>controller.changed()</tt> once the valid-status has changed, which will
        notify the listeners. Otherwise you have to fire a property change for
        <tt>PROP_VALID</tt>.</p>
    
    <p><h3>Have you tried to introduce the NetBeans Platform 
    at your workplace?</h3>
        
    <p>I tried introducing the NetBeans Platform at work for the 
    tools we are developing. Sadly, it has a rather large code base
    we're building on top of, so it is quite complicated to convince
    people it would be a smart move.

    <p>Also, Eclipse is the most widely used IDE here. People are
    rather fond of their IDE, even if they see some of the benefits
    of the NetBeans Platform.

    
    <div style="float: left;"><img src="nbm_interviews/emilian/quote1.png" alt="quote 2"></div>
        
    
    <p>Maybe this sounds like blasphemy but, once there is an Eclipse
    plugin for NetBeans Platform development, you've struck gold!
    Then, you'd have a clean migration path towards the 
    NetBeans Platform and, from there, to NetBeans IDE. Or at least
    merge, somehow, the NetBeans module system with OSGI. 
        
    <p><h3>What are your favorite NetBeans features?</h3>
        
    <p>The form editor (the Matisse GUI Builder) is getting rather
    powerful! Initially, I liked writing things by hand, since it 
    felt a lot more professional, but nowadays I feel
    no shame in using the IDE to make a Swing GUI!

    <p>The wizards are also getting a lot more powerful. I only use
    them on the module development side, but they are just great. They
    allow you to focus on what's application-specific, without 
    necessarily learning an entire new NetBeans API for a simple 
    feature. 
    
    <p><h3>If you could change one thing in module development 
    features in NetBeans, what would it be?</h3>
        
    <p>Remove cookies altogether and use just Lookup! Now it looks
    to me like a hibrid state. I don't think it serves anyone. 
    Backwards-compatibility sounds nice but there has to be a 
    limit... or at least a bleeding-edge fork. 
    
    <p><h3>In your experience, if I am an Eclipse user&#8212;what 
    would be the main reasons for thinking about using NetBeans 
    instead?</h3>
        
    <p>If you want to do Java EE development without shareware, edit
    an XML file without installing some plugin for the syntax 
    highlighting, create a nice JFrame without writing any line of 
    code&#8212;take a look at NetBeans IDE. The fact that you can
    take the ZIP release and unzip it on Linux and Windows
    and have them both work is also a plus. 
    
    <p><h3>Any final thoughts?</h3>
        
    <p>As a developer, I have to say I like the NetBeans Platform for
    what it offers and because of the way I see things get done on 
    <a href="https://netbeans.org">http://www.netbeans.org</a>. 
    For example, the NetBeans Javadoc is extraordinary. The 
    <tt>api.html</tt> pages are a killer and to have the DTD's, 
    properties defined, 
    UIManager keys and more in the Javadoc really gives you a global
    view of the module API. It just shows that lots of work has been 
    put into this.

    <p>The specs or proposals also look way nicer and people seem to 
    be doing some great work. For example, the 
    <a href="http://ui.netbeans.org/docs/ui/floating_windows/floating_windows.html">floating
    windows specification</a> is excellent. Other proposals are also
    impressive, due to the professionalism involved and to the fact
    that they are discussed first on the mailing list and refined.

    <p>This kind of quality work gives me a lot of confidence about
    the IDE and Platform and also an opportunity to learn from the best.
        
    <p><h3>Thanks Emilian and continue having fun with NetBeans!</h3>
