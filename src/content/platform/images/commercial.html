        Seeing is believing. These are examples of
        some of the applications companies, institutions, and students are building on
        top of the NetBeans Platform.

        <ul>
            <li>Are you about to develop a Java desktop application? <a href="https://platform.netbeans.org">Get a head-start and build on top

                <h3><b>Boeing Mass Properties Toolkit</b></h3>
                <p>The MassTk is an engineering analysis application by Boeing. It incorporates the functionality
                    from several legacy mass properties analysis applications that
                    were originally written in Java, Fortran, C, and even Perl.</p>
                <p>MassTk is built on top of the NetBeans Platform.
                    It provides a rich GUI with custom editors for all business objects including 2D &amp; 3D visualization.</p>
                <p>Boeing uses MassTk to perform
                    payload balance solutions, loadability analysis, fuel management analysis,
                    fuel mass property analysis, and mass distribution to finite element models.
                    MassTk vastly improved pre- and post-processing of analyses,
                    it has a shallower learning curve, and lower maintenance costs.

                <p>The Boeing Shared Platform is a logical outgrowth of building MassTk on top of the NetBeans Platform:
                    BSP is a feature-rich platform created by factoring out the modules from MassTk
                    that are not specific to mass properties analysis,
                    but are useful to engineering analysis applications in general. </p>
                <p>In addition to the NetBeans Platform, the BSP includes a number of
                    third-party open-source libraries, as well as a number of Boeing-developed modules. </p>

                <p>In a couple of months this
                    application was built on top
                    of the Boeing Shared Platform.
                    It is used for composite material

                <p>For the developer,
                    it was just a question of assembling
                    the pieces, because a large part of
                    the analysis code was already done
                    in historical applications, where it
                    wasn't easy to use and find. Now,
                    thanks to having integrated everything
                    via their shared platform, all derivative
                    applications gain from this centralization.

                    it.

                <p>Vinland, by Eriksfiord, is an application in the oil & gas exploration business.
                    Its mission is to make the daily life of geoscientists easier and to
                    avoid forcing them to become spreadsheet addicts, since
                    typically that's what they need to be. Lots of the applications/formulas
                    in the geomechanical arena are either hugely over-designed and
                    hopeless-to-use spreadsheets or very time consuming Finite Element models,
                    often run on poorly performing 32-bit based Windows boxes.</p>
                <p>The decision to use the NetBeans Platform in this case
                    was a combination of its OS independence,
                    its 100% Java content, and the fact that it
                    is fully Swing based, very well documented, and
                    has a very strong on-line community.

                <p>Traditional ways of numerically modeling multiphase flow in oil reservoirs are
                    based on finite element/finite difference methods. However, such methods can
                    pose computational inefficiencies for specific modeling scenarios.  Streamline-
                    based flow simulation is an alternative to cell-based methods and can
                    dramatically improve the computational efficiency of numerical models.

New model components can be added to the Latiz environment using the NetBeans modular architecture, thus allowing users to add functionality without modifying the Latiz source code.

                    the wizard framework of the NetBeans Platform, as well as the update center.
                    Combined, these features enable the application to be responsible for all
                    finances in the city, i.e., purchases and payments. The application processes
                    data via XML and then transforms and stores in a Derby database. Furthermore,
                    the application is used to analyze the data thus obtained and stored.

                <p>Karmasphere Studio for Hadoop is a map-reduce development
                    environment based on the NetBeans Platform.
                    It makes it easy to create, understand,
                    and debug map-reduce applications based
                    on Hadoop, without requiring development-time
                    access to a map-reduce cluster.
                <p>The studio provides
                    a real-time workflow view of a map-reduce job,
                    which displays the individual inputs, outputs,
                    and interactions between the phases of a
                    map-reduce job. The workflow view of a job
                    updates in real time with the developer's code changes.
                    It then generates Java sources and compiles them into
                    a binary JAR file, which can be run on a
                    normal Hadoop cluster.

In the end the data is signed, delivered to a Web Service, XML file or database. Or it could be rendered to a PDF and emailed. <a href="http://www.nspike.com/exampleFlows.html">Learn more...</a>
