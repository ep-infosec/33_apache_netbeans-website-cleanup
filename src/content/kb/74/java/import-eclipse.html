<a name="intro"></a><h2>The Import Eclipse Project Wizard</h2>
<p>An enhanced support for importing Eclipse projects is available in the NetBeans IDE. The Import Eclipse Project wizard enables you to use NetBeans to work on Java desktop and web
  application projects that were created in Eclipse and MyEclipse.</p>

<p>After creating a NetBeans project from an Eclipse project, you can work
in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use NetBeans on a team project where other developers are using Eclipse.
  </li>
  <li>Use NetBeans and Eclipse interchangeably on a project.
  </li>
  <li>Try out NetBeans on an existing project that was set up in Eclipse.  </li>
</ul>
<p class="align-center"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<a name="how-it-works"></a><h2>How the Import Wizard Works</h2>
<p>When you import a project, the IDE analyzes the Eclipse project metadata and then
  creates a NetBeans project based on that metadata. The project import
  does not impose changes on the Eclipse project
structure, so it does not interfere with the way the project works in Eclipse.</p>
<p>Once you have the project
  imported, you can use either or both the NetBeans and Eclipse IDEs to
  edit, build, run, debug, and profile the project.
  If you make a configuration change in the Eclipse project, you can resynchronize
  the NetBeans project. This enables you to work on projects in NetBeans even
  if everybody else on your team is working with Eclipse.
The build path that you set in Eclipse remains the master build path for the project.</p>
<p class="align-center"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h2><a name="import"></a>Importing and Configuring Projects</h2>

<p><b>To import an Eclipse project into the IDE:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure that you have copy of the project that you want to import on your system.
    <p>Typically, this project would already be in an Eclipse workspace on your
  system.</p></li>
  <li>Choose File &gt; Import Project &gt; Eclipse Project.</li>
  <li>In the Workspace Location page of the wizard, select the Import Projects from Workspace radio button and  specify the workspace location. Click Next.
   
	<p class="align-center"><a href="../../../images_www/articles/71/java/import-eclipse/eclipse-import-workspace-location.png" rel="lytebox" title="The Workspace Location page of the Import Eclipse Project wizard  - Click to enlarge">
  <img src="../../../images_www/articles/71/java/import-eclipse/eclipse-import-workspace-location-small.png" alt="The Workspace Location page of the Import Eclipse Project wizard " border=1></a></p></li>
  
  <li>In the Projects to Import page, select the projects that you want to
    import.</li>
  <li> Choose one of the following two options for storing the NetBeans project
    files:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Store NetBeans project data inside Eclipse project folders.</b>
        NetBeans adds folders and files within the top-level folder of the original
      project.</li>
      <li><b>Create imported NetBeans projects in a separate location.</b>
        NetBeans uses the sources and libraries in the
        original Eclipse project folder but creates a separate folder to hold
      NetBeans project metadata and build outputs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="notes"><b>Note:</b> Typically, it is better to store NetBeans project data inside
      Eclipse project folders. In most cases, this means that the NetBeans project
      metadata will refer to sources and libraries with the same paths that are used by
      the Eclipse metadata. Therefore, checking out the project from a version
      control system on different machines should result in similar behavior
    both in NetBeans and Eclipse.<br>
    See <a href="#metadata">NetBeans Project Files</a> below for a list of files and
  folders that the NetBeans IDE creates.</p>
  </li>
  <li>(Applicable when web applications are being imported only.) Click Next. In the Servers page, register any servers that your projects need with
  NetBeans IDE.</li>
  <li>Click Finish.</li>
</ol>

<p>After you have completed the wizard, the following dialog boxes might appear:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Import Issues.</b> This dialog box provides information about discrepancies
  between the project structure in Eclipse and in NetBeans and points out
  actions that you might need to take to correct the discrepancies.
  <br>You can copy the information from this dialog and paste it elsewhere for future reference.
  <br>In most cases, you use the project's Project Properties dialog box to
  resolve those issues. See <a href="#problems">Resolving Import Problems</a>
  for a guide to resolving the most common problems.
  <p class="align-center"><a href="../../../images_www/articles/71/java/import-eclipse/eclipse-import-issues.png" rel="lytebox" title="The Import Issues dialog box  - Click to enlarge">
  <img src="../../../images_www/articles/71/java/import-eclipse/eclipse-import-issues-small.png" alt="The Import Issues dialog box" border=1></a></p>

</li>
<li><b>Resolve Reference Problems.</b> This dialog box alerts you to a specific
  reference problem with one of your project libraries. You can solve this problem
  after dismissing this dialog box by right-clicking the project's node and
choosing Resolve Reference Problems.</li>
<li><b>Resolve Missing Server.</b>  This dialog box alerts you that the
  project can not find a necessary server. You can solve this problem
  after dismissing this dialog box by right-clicking the project's node and
choosing Resolve Missing Server.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you have completed the wizard and have closed any of the above
  informational dialog boxes, nodes for the projects will appear in the Projects window.
</p>

<p class="align-center"><img src="../../../images_www/articles/71/java/import-eclipse/eclipse-import-projects-window.png" 
     alt="The Projects window after a project has been imported." class="margin-around"></p>

<p>If there are references in your
  project metadata to servers or other resources that NetBeans can not resolve,
  the node for the project will appear in red. You can resolve these references
  immediately by right-clicking the project node and choosing Resolve Reference
  Problems or Resolve Missing Server.</p>
 
<p>For other types of project configuration adjustments, you use the
  Project Properties dialog box. You open the Project Properties dialog box
by right-clicking the project's node and choosing Properties.</p>
<p>For more information on configuring your project, see
<a href="project-setup.html#projects-configuring">Configuring the Classpath and Other Project Settings</a>
in the Creating, Importing, and Configuring Java Projects guide.</p>
<p class="align-center"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h2><a name="build"></a>Building and Running a Project</h2>

<p>Once you have the project imported into NetBeans, you can build and run the
project. All artifacts created from NetBeans build and run commands are created in
the <code>build</code> and <code>dist</code> folders. NetBeans does not
over-write output created from Eclipse build actions. If the Eclipse project already
has <code>build</code> and <code>dist</code> folders,
the NetBeans project creates folders called
<code>nbbuild</code> and <code>nbdist</code> and uses those for the build outputs.</p>
<p>The following are some of the build and run commands are available from the Run menu:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Run Project.</b> Test runs the application in the IDE.</li>
  <li><b>Clean and Build Project.</b> Deletes the contents of the <code>build</code>
    (or <code>nbbuild</code>) and <code>dist</code> (or <code>nbdist</code>)
    folders and rebuilds all of the project's outputs. Uses
    the NetBeans build script.
  Similar to the Clean command in Eclipse.</li>
  <li><b>Clean.</b> Deletes the contents of the <code>nbbuild</code>
  and <code>nbdist</code> folders.</li>
  <li><b>Build.</b> Rebuilds the project's outputs. If the Compile on Save
  feature is enabled, the Build command is disabled. See the
  <a href="project-setup.html#building-compile-on-save">Compile on Save</a> section
  of the Creating, Importing, and Configuring Java Projects guide.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information on building and running your application as well as
customizing the build process, see
<a href="project-setup.html">Creating, Importing, and Configuring Java Projects</a>.
</p>
<p class="align-center"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h2><a name="metadata"></a>NetBeans Project Files</h2>

<p>After you have imported the project, you will find the following folder and files
on your system:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>build.xml</code> file or <code>nb-build.xml</code> file. The main NetBeans build
    script for the project. You can customize this script according to the needs
    of your project. By default, this file is called <code>build.xml</code>.
    If such a file already exists in the project folder, the script is called
  <code>nb-build.xml</code>.</li>
  <li><code>nbproject</code> folder. Contains most of the NetBeans project metadata,
    including resources that are called by the main NetBeans build script. If you check
    this folder and the <code>build.xml</code> file or <code>nb-build.xml</code>
    into your version control system, other users will be able to
    open the project in NetBeans. This folder also contains the <code>private</code>
    folder, which contains data specific to your system. This folder should not
    be checked in to the version control system since its contents will vary
  between users. See <a href="#versioning">Version Control Considerations</a> below.</li>
  <li><code>nbbuild</code> folder. When you build or run your project in NetBeans,
  the project's sources are compiled into this folder.</li>
  <li><code>nbdist</code> folder. When you build your project in NetBeans,
    the project's distributable outputs are created and placed in this folder.
  Such outputs might be JAR files and WAR files.</li>
</ul>
<p class="align-center"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
  <a name="versioning"></a><h2>Version Control Considerations</h2>
  <p>If the project is checked out of a version control system,
    the <code>build</code> (or <code>nbbuild</code>),
    <code>dist</code> (or <code>nbdist</code>), and the <code>nbproject/private</code>
  folders should not be checked into that version control system. </p>
  <p>If the project
    is under the CVS, Subversion, or Mercurial version control systems, the
    appropriate &quot;ignore&quot; files are created or updated for these directories when
  the project is imported.</p>
  <p class="notes">Though <code>nbproject/private</code> should be ignored,
    <code>nbproject</code> should be checked into the version control system.
    <code>nbproject</code> contains project metadata that enables others users to
  open the project in NetBeans without having to import the project first.</p>
  <p class="align-center"><a href="#top">top</a></p>

<h2><a name="resynch"></a>Resynchronizing a Project</h2>

<p>The project importer features synchronization capabilities. If
  the classpath in the Eclipse has changed since you initially imported it, you can
  use the Resynchronize Eclipse Projects feature to update the classpath
in the corresponding NetBeans project.</p>
<p>Project resynchronization is one-way from Eclipse projects to NetBeans projects.
If you make changes to the project structure in NetBeans, those changes are not
propagated to the Eclipse project with the resynchronization feature.
If you intend to keep both Eclipse and NetBeans projects, use the Eclipse project
as the &quot;master&quot; project.</p>
<p>The IDE also resynchronizes the projects automatically if the changes to the
Eclipse configuration are unambiguous and do not require your input. This
automatic resynchronization occurs shortly after you open the project.
If the resynchronization requires your input, you need to manually
resynchronize the project.</p>

<!-- TODO add information on what gets synchronized-->
<p><b>To manually resynchronize NetBeans projects with Eclipse projects:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Choose File &gt; Import Project &gt; Resynchronize Eclipse Projects.</li>
</ul>
<p class="notes"><b>Notes:</b> When you resynchronize a project, the resynchronization
is performed on all projects that you have imported from the workspace.</p>

<p class="align-center"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h2><a name="problems"></a>Resolving Import Problems</h2>

<p>When you import a project into NetBeans, there might be some things that can
  not be automatically resolved in NetBeans IDE. For some of these problems,
  a menu item, such as Resolve Missing Server Problem, appears in the contextual menu for the project.
  Other problems can be resolved
  in the Project Properties dialog box for the imported project in NetBeans IDE.
</p>
<p>Here is a list of common import problems and their solutions.</p>
