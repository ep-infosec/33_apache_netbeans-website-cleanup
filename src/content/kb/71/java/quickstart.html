        <h1>NetBeans IDE Java Quick Start Tutorial</h1>

        <p>Welcome to NetBeans IDE!</p>
        <p>This tutorial provides a very simple and quick introduction to the NetBeans IDE workflow by walking you through the creation of a
            simple &quot;Hello World&quot; Java console application. Once you are done with this tutorial, you will have a general knowledge of how
        to create and run applications in the IDE.</p>
        <p>This tutorial takes less than 10 minutes to complete.</p>
        <p>After you finish this tutorial, you can move on to the learning trails,
            which are linked from the <a href="../../index.html">Documentation, Training &amp; Support</a> page.
            The learning trails provide comprehensive tutorials that highlight a wider range of
            IDE features and programming techniques for a variety of application types. If you do not want to do a &quot;Hello World&quot; application,
            you can skip this tutorial and jump straight to the learning trails.

        <h2>Setting Up the Project<a name="setup"></a></h2>
        <p>To create an IDE project:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Start NetBeans IDE.</li>
            <li>In the IDE, choose File &gt; New Project (Ctrl-Shift-N), as shown in the figure below.
                <p class="align-center"><img src="../../../images_www/articles/71/java/quickstart/new-proj.png" alt="NetBeans IDE with the File &gt; New Project menu item selected." class="margin-around"></p>
            </li>
            <li>In the New Project wizard, expand the Java category and select Java Application as shown in the figure below. Then click Next.
               <p class="align-center"> <img src="../../../images_www/articles/71/java/quickstart/proj-wizard.png" alt="NetBeans IDE, New Project wizard, Choose Project page." class="margin-around"></p>
            </li>
            <li>In the Name and Location page of the wizard, do the following (as shown in the figure below):

                <ul>
                    <li>In the Project Name field, type <code>HelloWorldApp</code>.</li>
                    <li>Leave the Use Dedicated Folder for Storing Libraries checkbox unselected.</li>
                    <li>In the Create Main Class field, type <code>helloworldapp.HelloWorldApp</code>.</li>
                    <li>Leave the Set as Main Project checkbox selected.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="align-center"><img src="../../../images_www/articles/71/java/quickstart/proj-wizard2.png" alt="NetBeans IDE, New Project wizard, Name and Location page."  class="margin-around"></p>
            </li>
            <li>Click Finish.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The project is created and opened in the IDE. You should see the following components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Projects window, which contains a tree view of the components of the project,
                including source files, libraries that your code depends on, and so on.
            </li>
            <li>The Source Editor window with a file called <code>HelloWorldApp</code> open.
            </li>
            <li>The Navigator window, which you can use to quickly navigate between
            elements within the selected class.</li>
            <li>The Tasks window, which lists compilation errors as well other tasks
            that are marked with keywords such as XXX and TODO.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="align-center"><img src="../../../images_www/articles/71/java/quickstart/proj-opened.png"  alt="NetBeans IDE with the HelloWorldApp project open." class="margin-around"></p>
        <h2><a name="code"></a>Adding Code to the Generated Source File
        </h2>
        <p>Because you have left the Create Main Class checkbox selected in the
        New Project wizard, the IDE has created a skeleton main class for you.
        You can add the &quot;Hello World!&quot; message to the
        skeleton code by replacing the line:</p>

        <pre class="examplecode">
            // TODO code application logic here
        </pre>

        with the line:

        <pre class="examplecode">
            System.out.println(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
        </pre>

        <p>Save the change by choosing File &gt; Save.</p>

        <p>The file should look something like the following code sample.</p>
        <pre class="examplecode">
/*
 * To change this template, choose Tools | Templates
 * and open the template in the editor.
 */

package helloworldapp;

/**
 *
 * @author &lt;your name&gt;
 */
public class HelloWorldApp {

    /**
     * @param args the command line arguments
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
    }

}

        </pre>

        <a name="run"></a><h2>Compiling and Running the Program</h2>
        <p>Because of the IDE's Compile on Save feature, you do not have to manually compile
            your project in order to run it in the IDE. When you save a Java source file, the IDE
        automatically compiles it.</p>
        <p class="notes">The Compile on Save feature can be turned off in the Project Properties window. Right-click your project, select Properties. In the Properties window, choose the Compiling tab. The Compile on Save checkbox is right at the top. Note that in the Project Properties window you can configure numerous settings for your project: project libraries, packaging, building, running, etc. </p>
        <p><b>To run the program:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose Run &gt; Run Main Project (F6).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The next figure shows what you should now see.</p>
        <p class="align-center"><img src="../../../images_www/articles/71/java/quickstart/run-output.png" ALT="The program prints Hello World! to the Output window (along with other output from the build script)." class="margin-around"></p>
        <p>
            Congratulations! Your program works!
        </p>

        <p>If there are compilation errors, they are marked with red glyphs
            in the left and right margins of the Source Editor. The glyphs in the left
            margin indicate errors for the corresponding lines. The glyphs in the right
            margin show all of the areas of the file that have errors, including errors
            in lines that are not visible. You can mouse over an error mark to get a
            description of the error. You can click a glyph in the right margin to jump
            to the line with the error.
        </p>

        <a name="build"></a>
        <h2>Building and Deploying the Application </h2>

        <p>Once you have written and test run your application, you can
            use the Clean and Build command to build your application for deployment.
            When you use the Clean and Build command, the
         IDE runs a build script that performs the following tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deletes any previously compiled files and
            other build outputs.</li>
            <li>Recompiles the application and builds a JAR file
            containing the compiled files.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>To build your application:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose Run &gt; Clean and Build Main Project (Shift-F11)  </li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can view the build outputs by opening the Files window and expanding
        the <tt>HelloWorldApp</tt> node. The compiled bytecode file <code>HelloWorldApp.class</code> is within the <code>build/classes/helloworldapp</code> subnode.
          A deployable JAR file that contains the <code>HelloWorldApp.class</code> is within the <code>dist</code> node.</p>
        <p class="align-center"><img src="../../../images_www/articles/71/java/quickstart/files-window.png"
         alt="Image showing the Files window with the nodes for the HelloWorldApp expanded to show the contents of the build and dist subnodes." class="margin-around"></p>

<p>For information on how to run the application from the command line for your operating system, see the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/cupojava/index.html" target="_blank">&quot;The &quot;Hello World&quot; Application&quot;</a> lesson of the Java Tutorials. </p>
