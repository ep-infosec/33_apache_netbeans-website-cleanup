<H1>Import an Eclipse Project Ignoring Project Dependencies</H1>

<P>This section walks through the procedure of importing an
Eclipse project while ignoring project dependencies.</P>


<P>To initiate an import of an Eclipse project, ignoring any project
dependencies that may exist, select the File &gt; Import Project &gt; Eclipse
Project menu in the NetBeans IDE. This will display the Import Eclipse
Project wizard. From the Import Eclipse Project wizard, select the
option <i>Import Project Ignoring Project Dependencies</i> and specify the
Eclipse project to import and the destination folder.

An example
is shown below.</P>

</P>
<P>
After specifying the Eclipse project to import and the
destination folder, press Finish
</P>


<P>The NetBeans Eclipse Project Importer
is rather sophisticated in its processing of Eclipse projects. For
instance, if the NetBeans Eclipse Project Importer discovers Eclipse
project discrepancies while processing the
Eclipse project information and believes it
can resolve those discrepancies, NetBeans
will display a dialog showing the Eclipse project discrepancies
it has found and the corrective actions NetBeans has taken to handle
those Eclipse project discrepancies. If you see this dialog, there is
no additional work required by you. The dialog is meant to be an
informative dialog to let you know the NetBeans Eclipse Project
Importer has found discreprancies in the Eclipse project NetBeans is
importing. For more information see <A HREF="eclipse-discrepancies.html">Handling
Eclipse Project Discrepancies</A>.</P>
<P>If
the NetBeans Eclipse Project Importer discovers problems in an
Eclipse project such as a project resource that could not be found,
NetBeans will display a Reference Problems warning dialog along with
appropriate actions for you to take to resolve these Eclipse project
references once the project has been imported into NetBeans. This
dialog is presented to the user so that he or she may correct
problems that have been detected in the Eclipse project while the
NetBeans Eclipse Project Importer was processing the Eclipse project
information. See <A HREF="eclipse-references.html">Handling
Eclipse Project Reference Problems</A>
for additional information.</P>


<P>
If there were no Eclipse project reference problems
discovered by NetBeans during the Eclipse project import which
require a resolution, you may begin using the NetBeans IDE on your
old Eclipse projects you have just imported. For instance, you can
immediately use the NetBeans IDE Project Viewer to traverse the
imported project or you can begin running your newly imported Eclipse
project.</P>


<p><h2>Viewing the Imported Projects</h2>

<P>Once NetBeans has completed the Eclipse
project import, you view the imported project in NetBeans by opening
the Projects window.</P>

<p><h2>Running the Imported Projects</h2>

<P>Once you have imported your Eclipse
project you can run it in NetBeans by opening the NetBeans Projects
window, right clicking on the project and selecting Run as shown below.</P>

That's it! As you can see, migrating Eclipse projects to
NetBeans is very easy with the NetBeans Eclipse Project Importer.</P>
