<h1>Uncovering Memory Leaks Using NetBeans Profiler</h1>
<div class="articledate" style="margin-left: 0px;">Contributed by Jiri Sedlacek</div>
<p>This articles discusses how to use the NetBeans Profiler to locate memory leaks in
a Java application. </p>
<h2>What's a Memory Leak?</h2>

<p>"Memory leak is a particular kind of unintentional memory consumption by a computer program 
where the program fails to release memory when no longer needed" as 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak">Wikipedia</a> says. 
This can happen for any program written in any programming language and Java is no exception.</p>

<p>Many users think that the Java VM releases unused objects from memory automatically, but that's not always the case. 
There are several scenarios when objects cannot be released and memory leaks occur. 
One common scenario is when a single object with large memory consumption may be unintentionally held in memory,
for example a <code>Project</code> instance in NetBeans IDE when the project has already been closed. 
Another common scenario is when small objects are constantly being added to a <code>Collection</code> 
over time but they are never removed from that <code>Collection</code>, for example caching coordinates in a graphics editor or a game.</p>

<h2>How Can I Detect a Memory Leak?</h2>

<p>In the first scenario, when a single (or few) object remains in memory after some 
action, memory leak detection is typically done by comparing memory snapshots taken before the action to snapshots taken after the action and then 
searching for unnecessary references to that object(s) in a heap walker tool. <!--This technique will be covered in
a subsequent article on uncovering memory leaks.--></p>

<p>This article will cover the second scenario, when there are many small objects that are continuously accumulating without being released.
This type of leak can be more difficult to detect because typically it's not related to any concrete action and does not use a
noticeable amount of memory until the program has run for a long time. 
This scenario is dangerous especially with Java EE applications that are expected to run 
for long periods of time. 
After some time the leak starts to consume memory and may slow down performance of the 
application or cause an <code>OutOfMemoryError</code> crash without any visible cause.</p>

<p>Even if your application seems to be working without any problems, before releasing your application it's always a good idea 
to verify that your application does not contain any potential memory leaks. 
For this purpose the NetBeans Profiler offers you special metrics which can reliably uncover 
large amounts of continuously leaking small objects - the <b>Surviving Generations metrics</b>. 
You can start the application in Monitoring mode without any profiling overhead and 
watch the graph to see if the application leaks over time.</p>

<h2>What Do The Surviving Generations Metrics Mean?</h2>

<p>Surviving Generations metrics cannot be easily defined with just one line, so let's make a three-line definition:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>a Generation is a set of instances created within the same GC interval (between two garbage collections)</i></li>
  <li><i>a Surviving Generation is a Generation that survives at least one garbage collection. The number of 
  survived garbage collections - the generation's age - is its unique identifier</i></li>
  <li><i>Surviving Generations (metrics) value is the number of different Surviving Generations 
  that are currently alive on the heap (number of Generations with different generation ages)</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Typically there are several long-lived objects (like an application's main <code>JFrame</code> etc.) in an application. 
The generation's age increases during the application's run time but still represents one or a few Surviving Generations.</p>

<p>Most applications also have short-lived objects which are created very frequently 
(such as <code>Dimension</code> etc.) but these objects are released very soon, typically within only a few garbage collections. 
This means that they represent only a few Surviving Generations (with generation's age of 1, 2, 3 etc.).</p>

<p>If we merge the two above cases, the total number of Surviving Generations in typical applications is 
quite stable. You may have long-lived objects representing, for example, 3 Surviving Generations, and short-lived 
objects representing, for example, 5 Surviving Generations, which means there will be about 8 Surviving Generations during the application's runtime.</p>

<p>Of course, in some application, for example a Swing application, dialogs and other components are created 
during run time and as a result the number of Surviving Generations grows a bit. 
But after some period of time the number of Surviving Generations should become stable 
because all long-lived objects have already been created and newly-created 
short-lived objects are periodically being released from the heap.</p>

<p>However, if there is a memory leak in an application which prevents newly-created 
objects from being released from the heap (for example objects stored in a <code>Collection</code> 
and never removed), the number of Surviving Generations grows. Why? Because between every two 
garbage collections a new generation (of leaking objects) is created and it survives each 
successive garbage collection. During run time the number of Surviving Generations whose 
generation's age differ by one unit increases, and that's exactly what the Surviving Generations 
metrics is able to detect regardless of how much memory is wasted by such a leak. 
That's why using the Surviving Generations metrics can help you discover a memory leak much 
sooner, before it consumes the entire heap and causes an <code>OutOfMemoryError</code>.</p>

<h2>How To Do It With NetBeans Profiler?</h2>

<p>The NetBeans Profiler is included as part of the regular installation of current versions of NetBeans IDE.
    If you are using an older version of the IDE that does not include all the profiler features (NetBeans IDE 6.1 or earlier)
    you might need to download and install the
    <a href="http://profiler.netbeans.org/download/index.html">NetBeans Profiler installer package</a>.</p>

<div class="indent">
<h3>Discovering the Leak</h3>
<ol>

  <li>Download and install <a href="https://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html">NetBeans IDE</a>.</li>
  <li>Open the project that you want to check for possible memory leaks.</li>
  <li>Choose Profile &gt; Profile Project from the main menu to start profiling the project.
      <p>Alternatively, choose Attach Profiler if you want to attach the NetBeans Profiler to an external application. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Choose the Monitor mode and click Run. (You don't need to monitor application's threads.)
  <br />
<!--  <img alt="screenshot of Select Profiling Task dialog box" src="../../images_www/articles/profiler/monitor_application_screen.png" />-->
      <img alt="screenshot of Telemetry overview" src="../../images_www/articles/profiler/monitor-wizard.png" class="margin-around b-all"/>
      <p><i>Image 1: Monitor Application mode. </i></p>
</li>

  <li>Open the small telemetry graphs (menu Profile/View/Telemetry Overview) or large Memory (GC) 
  graph using the VM Telemetry button in the NetBeans Profiler Control Panel and watch the behavior of the red Surviving Generations 
  metrics line during the application's run time. The longer the application runs in monitoring 
  mode with a realistic workload, the more precise the memory leak analysis will be.
  <br/>

 <p><i>Image 2: VM Telemetry Overview showing how the Surviving Generations value increases after application 
         startup (the exact number of surviving generations is not important). 
 If the value continues to increase during run time, the application is very likely leaking.</i></p>
 <p>Typically, the Surviving Generations value starts to grow during an application's startup, 
  but after some time it should reach some stable limit and level off. When this happens it indicates that no objects 
  are being created continuously and leaking. If the Surviving Generations line continues 
  to grow all the time (regardless of how quickly), then the application is most likely leaking.</p></li>
</ol>
  <p>If you discover a memory leak using the Surviving Generations metrics during
  monitoring, the NetBeans Profiler enables you to easily find the code in your application where the leaking 
  objects are created and fix the problem.</p>

  <h3>Discovering the Source</h3>
  <p>To find the suspect code, perform the following steps.</p>
  <ol>
      <li>Switch the profiling mode to Memory mode and select Record stack trace for allocations.<br/>
      <img alt="screenshot of Memory mode" src="../../images_www/articles/profiler/memory-wizard.png" class="margin-around b-all"/>
      </li>
      <li>Open the live results and click the Generations column heading to sort the results by Surviving Generations value.<br/>
      <img alt="screenshot of Live Profiling Results tab" src="../../images_www/articles/profiler/live-results.png" class="margin-around b-all"/>
      <p><i>Image 3: The Live Profiling Results tab shows that the <code>double[]</code> and <code>float[]</code> entries are
      continuously being created and not released.
      This is a potential memory leak even though they don't consume much memory.</i></p>
      </li>
      <li>Right-click the class with the continuously growing Surviving Generations value
      and choose Take Snapshot and Show Allocations Stack Traces in the popup menu.<br/>
      <img alt="screenshot of Allocation Stack trace" src="../../images_www/articles/profiler/stack-trace.png" class="margin-around b-all"/>
      <p>The IDE displays opens the stack trace that enables you to locate code that is
      the possible source of the leak. You can right-click the class name and choose Go to Source
      in the popup menu to open the class in the editor.</p>
      </li>
  </ol> 

  </div>

  <p>Follow these steps to locate all the methods of your code where instances of the class are being created.
  The method(s) with the highest Surviving Generations value is most likely the cause of the leak. </p>
