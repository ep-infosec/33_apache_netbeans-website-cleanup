<h1>Handling Eclipse Project Discrepancies</h1>

<p>If NetBeans identifies Eclipse project discrepancies while importing an
Eclipse project, a warning dialog will be displayed explaining the
Eclipse project discrepancies discovered along with the action NetBeans
will take in dealing with the Eclipse project discrepancies found. . The
warning dialog is informative. You do not need to take any additional
action when this warning dialog appears.

<p>An example dialog is shown
below which illustrates an Eclipse project discrepancy
found by NetBeans during an Eclipse project import and shows the
corrective action taken by NetBeans to fix the Eclipse project
discrepancy.</P>

</P>
<P>That's all there is to handling Eclipse
project discrepancies. The NetBeans Eclipse
Project Importer has automatically resolved the Eclipse project
discrepancies for you and informs you of
the changes it made.</P>
