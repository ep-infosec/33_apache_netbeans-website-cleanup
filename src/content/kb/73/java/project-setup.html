        <a name="ide-concepts"></a><h2>Basic Project Concepts</h2>
        <p>This section provides an overview of some background information on the
        IDE's project system.</p>
        <div class="indent">
            <a name="ide-projects"></a><h3 class="tutorial">Projects</h3>
            <p>
                In the IDE, you always work inside of a project. In addition to source files,
                an IDE project contains metadata about what belongs on the classpath,
                how to build and run the project, and so on.
                The IDE stores project information in a project folder which includes an Ant
                build script and properties file that control the build and run settings, and
                a <code>project.xml</code>
            file that maps Ant targets to IDE commands.</p>
            <p class="notes"><b>Note:</b>
                Though the IDE puts source directories within the project folder by default,
            your source directories do not necessarily need to be located in the project folder.</p>


            <a name="ide-ant"></a><h3 class="tutorial">Ant</h3>
            <p>Apache Ant is a Java-based build tool used to standardize and automate build
                and run environments for development. The IDE's project system is based
                directly on Ant. All of the project commands, like Clean and Build Project
                and Debug, call targets in the project's Ant script. You can
                therefore build and run your project outside the IDE exactly as it is built
            and run inside the IDE.</p>
            <p>It is not necessary to know Ant to work with the IDE. You can set all the
                basic compilation and runtime options in the project's Project Properties
                dialog box and the IDE automatically updates your project's Ant script.
                If you are familiar with Ant, you can customize a standard project's Ant
            script or write your own Ant script for a project.</p>
        </div>
        <a name="projects-creating"></a><h2>Creating a Project</h2>
        <p><b>To create a new project:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose <tt>File</tt> &gt; <tt>New Project (Ctrl-Shift-N on Windows/Cmd-Shift-N on OS X)</tt>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When the New Project wizard appears,  select the  right template for your
        project and complete the remaining wizard steps. The project template icon can be displayed in gray, which means that this project type has not been activated. Proceed with creating the project and this functionality will be activated in the IDE.  </p>
        <p>The IDE contains the following standard project templates for Java and Java Web applications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Java Application.</b> Creates a skeleton Java SE project with a main class.
                See <a href="javase-intro.html">Developing and Deploying General Java Applications</a>
                for a brief tutorial that uses this template.
            </li>
            <li><b>Java Class Library.</b> Creates a skeleton Java class library
                without a main class.
                See <a href="javase-intro.html">Developing and Deploying General Java Applications</a>
            for a brief tutorial that uses this template.</li>
            <li><b>Java Project with Existing Sources.</b> Creates a Java SE
                project based on your own Java sources.
                See <a href="#existing-java-sources">Setting Up a Java Project Based on Existing Sources</a>
            below.</li>
            <li><b>Web Application.</b> Creates a skeleton web application,
                including options to add various web frameworks. See
                <a href="../../../kb/docs/web/quickstart-webapps.html">Introduction to Developing Web Applications</a>
            for an example that uses this template.</li>
            <li><b>Web Application with Existing Sources.</b> Creates a web
                project based on your own web and Java sources. See
                <a href="#existing-web-sources">Setting Up a Web Project Based on Existing Sources</a>
            below.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, the IDE also contains templates for EJB modules, enterprise applications,
        Java ME applications, and more.</p>
        <p>The Java and Web project categories also have
            free-form project templates. The free-form templates
            enable you to use an existing Ant script for a project but require
        manual configuration. See <a href="#free-form">Free-Form Projects</a> below.</p>
        <p>When you finish creating a project, it opens in the IDE with its logical
            structure displayed in the Projects window and its file structure displayed
        in the Files window:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The Projects window is the main entry point to your project sources.
                It shows a logical view of important project contents such as Java
                packages and Web pages. You can right-click any project node to access a
                popup menu of commands for building, running, and debugging the project,
                as well as opening the Project Properties dialog box. The Projects
            window can be opened by choosing Window &gt; Projects (Ctrl-1 on Windows/Cmd-1 on OS X).</li>
            <li>
                The Files window shows a directory-based view of your projects,
                including files and folders that are not displayed in the Projects
                window. From the Files window, you can open and edit your project
                configuration files, such as the project's build script and properties
                file. You can also view build output like compiled classes, JAR files,
                WAR files, and generated Javadoc documentation. The Files window can be
            opened by choosing Window &gt; Files (Ctrl-2 on Windows/Cmd-2 on OS X).</li>
        </ul>

					   <img src="../../../images_www/articles/72/java/project-setup/files-project-window-small.png" alt="Files and Projects windows" border=1></a></p>

        <p class="notes"><b>Note:</b>
            If you need to access files and directories that are outside of your project
            directories, you can use the Favorites window.
            You open the Favorites window by choosing <tt>Window</tt> &gt; <tt>Favorites (Ctrl-3 on Windows/Cmd-3 on OS X)</tt>.
            You add a folder or file to the Favorites window by right-clicking in the
        Favorites window and choosing Add to Favorites.</p>

        <a name="projects-importing"></a><h2 class="tutorial">Importing a Project</h2>
        <p>This section shows you how to handle the initial importing of projects
        into the IDE.</p>
        <div class="indent">
            <a name="import-eclipse"></a><h3 class="tutorials">Importing an Eclipse Workspace</h3>
            <p>For Eclipse projects, you can use the Import Eclipse Project wizard to
                help you create NetBeans projects from projects in an Eclipse workspace
                and import the project classpaths and other settings. When you
                use the Import Eclipse Project wizard, you do not need to use
                create and configure the NetBeans project manually. Open the wizard by
                choosing <tt>File</tt> &gt; <tt>Import Project</tt> &gt; <tt>Eclipse Project</tt>. See
                <a href="../../../kb/docs/java/import-eclipse.html">Importing Eclipse Projects into NetBeans IDE</a>
                for information on how the wizard works and how you can work
            simultaneously in Eclipse and NetBeans projects.</p>

            <a name="existing-java-sources"></a><h3 class="tutorials">Setting Up a Java Project Based on Existing Sources</h3>
            <p>For other Java projects developed outside of NetBeans, you use an &quot;Existing Sources&quot; template
            in the New Project wizard to make a NetBeans project. In the wizard,
            you identify the location of the
            sources and specify a location for the NetBeans project metadata. You
            then use the Project Properties dialog box to
            <a href="#projects-configuring">configure the project</a>.</p>
            <p><b>To set up a NetBeans project for an existing Java application:</b></p>
            <ol>

            <h3 class="tutorial">Free-Form Projects</h3>
            <p>There are also project templates available for free-form projects.
                In free-form projects, the IDE uses targets in an existing Ant script to
                build, run, clean, test, and debug your application. If the Ant script does
                not contain targets for some of these functions, the functions are
                unavailable for the project. To implement these functions you write targets either in your Ant
            script or in a secondary Ant script. </p>
            <p>In general,
                it is better to use standard &quot;With Existing Sources&quot; project templates for importing projects.
                For Eclipse projects, it is best to use the Import Project feature, which creates and
                configures a standard project for you.
                Standard projects are easier to maintain in the long term. However, the free-form
                project templates can be useful if you have an existing Ant-based project with
                a complex or idiosyncratic configuration that can not be replicated within a standard
                project. For example, if you are importing a project with multiple source roots, each of
                which has a different classpath, and you can not split the source roots into different projects,
            it might be necessary to use a free-form project template.</p>
            <p>This guide focuses on standard projects. For more information on setting up free-form projects, see

        <a name="projects-configuring"></a><h2>Configuring the Classpath and Other Project Settings</h2>
        <p>This section covers the most common tasks in setting up a
            project, such as setting the project's target JDK, setting the classpath,
            creating dependencies between projects, and sharing libraries between
        projects and users.</p>
        <div class="indent">
            <a name="projects-main"></a><h3 class="tutorial">Setting the Main Project</h3>
            <p>When you develop a large application consisting of numerous
                source folders, it is common to split up your code into
                separate projects. Typically, one of these projects serves as the entry
                point for your application. To tell the IDE which of your projects
                is the main entry point for your application, you set one project to
                be the main project. The IDE provides commands that act on the main project.
                For example, running the Clean and Build Main Project command builds both the
            main project and all of its required projects. </p>
            <p><b>To set a project as the main project:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Right-click the project node in the Projects window, and
                choose Set as Main Project. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Only one project can be the main project at a time.</p>
            <a name="projects-jdk"></a>
            <h3 class="tutorial">Setting the Target JDK in a Project</h3>
            <p>In the IDE, you can register multiple Java platforms and attach Javadoc
                and source code to each platform. Switching the target JDK for a
            standard project does the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Offers the new target JDK's classes for code completion.</li>
                <li>If available, displays the target JDK's source code and Javadoc documentation.</li>
                <li>Uses the target JDK's executables (<code>javac</code>
                and <code>java</code>) to compile and execute your application.</li>
                <li>Compiles your source code against the target JDK's libraries.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By default, the IDE uses the version of the Java SE platform (JDK)
                on which the IDE runs as the default Java platform for IDE projects.
                You can view your IDE's JDK version by choosing <tt>Help</tt> &gt; <tt>About</tt>. The JDK version is listed in the Java field.</p>
            <p><b>To run the IDE with a different JDK version:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start the IDE with the following switch from the command line.
                    <pre>--jdkhome jdk-home-dir</pre>
                    <p>Alternatively, set the JDK in the <code>/etc/netbeans.conf</code>
                    file that is located in the IDE's installation folder. </p>
                </li>
            </ul>


            <p><b>To register a new Java platform:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Choose <tt>Tools</tt> &gt; <tt>Java Platforms</tt>
                from the main menu.</li>
                <li>Specify the folder that contains the Java platform
                as well as the sources and Javadoc needed for debugging.</li>

            <a name="projects-classpath"></a><h3 class="tutorial">Managing a Project's Classpath</h3>
            <p>
                Adding a group of class files to a project's classpath tells the IDE which
                classes the project should have access to during compilation and
                execution. The IDE also uses classpath settings to enable code
                completion, automatic highlighting of compilation errors, and
                refactoring. You can edit the classpath declarations for an existing
            project in the Project Properties dialog box.</p>
            <p>
                In standard Java projects, the IDE maintains separate classpaths for compiling
                and running your project, as well as compiling and running
                JUnit tests (for Java SE applications). The IDE automatically adds
                everything on your project's compilation classpath to the project's
                runtime classpath.
            </p>
            <p><b>You can modify your project's classpath in either of the following ways:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Right-click the project's node, choose Properties,
                    select the Libraries category, and modify the listed
                classpath entries.</li>
                <li>Right-click the Libraries node in the Projects window
                and choose Add Project, Add Library, or Add JAR/Folder.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you have attached Javadoc and source files to a JAR file in the
                Library Manager, the IDE automatically adds the Javadoc and
                source files to the project when you register the JAR file on a
                project's classpath. You can step into classes and look up Javadoc
            pages for the classes without configuring anything else.</p>

            <a name="projects-dependencies"></a>
            <h3 class="tutorial">Managing Dependencies Between Projects</h3>
            <p>
                If your application consists of multiple projects, you
                have to set up the classpath dependencies between the projects.
                Typically you set up one main project containing the project main
                class (in Java SE projects), and several required projects. A required
                project is a project that has been added to another project's classpath.
                When you clean and build a project, the IDE also cleans and builds its
                required projects. The required project's Javadoc and sources are also
            made available to the receiving project. </p>
            <p>
                You can add any required projects to your project by right-clicking
                the Libraries node in the Projects window, or you can add them by
                specifying them in the Libraries tab in the Project Properties dialog box.
                When you want to add a required project, select the project folder whose
                JAR files you want to add to the classpath (the file chooser displays the
                icon for IDE project folders
                (<img src="../../../images_www/articles/72/java/project-setup/projectfolder.png" ALIGN="bottom" alt="Project Folder icon">
                ). When adding projects in the Project Properties dialog box, make
            sure that the Build Projects on Classpath checkbox is selected.</p>
            <p>
                If you want to add a free-form project to the classpath of a standard project,
                you have to add the free-form project's JAR file to the standard project's
                classpath. To do this, you must first declare all of the free-form project's
                output files in the Output panel of the free-form project's Project Properties
            dialog box.</p>

            <a name="projects-shared-libraries"></a><h3 class="tutorial">Sharing Project Libraries</h3>

            <p>As the NetBeans IDE project system is Ant-based, NetBeans
                projects are already generally portable between different users, whether or not
                they use the IDE. However, by default, the project build script's way of
                referring to libraries is dependent on factors specific to each user,
            particularly in the case of libraries defined in the Library Manager dialog box.</p>

            <p>For example, normally you can put a project in a zip file and give it to another
                user to unpack and run. But if the project depends on a custom library that
                you have specified in the Libraries Manager dialog box, others might
                initially have problems building the project because of unresolved references
            to the custom library.</p>

            <p>Another potential inconvenience is that libraries are stored in a variety of locations,
                based on where they originate. Libraries that come with the IDE are stored in
                various different folders within the IDE's installation. Examples of these
                include the libraries for the Swing Layout Extensions, beans binding, and
            database drivers.</p>

            <p>To solve these problems, you can specify a dedicated folder for project libraries.
                Furthermore, you have control over whether to use an relative path or an
            absolute path when referring to these libraries. </p>
            <p>This flexibility makes it easier for you to handle the following situations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You create a project and need to make it available and buildable to
                    other users, whether they use the IDE or not. They should be able to access
                    the project through a version control checkout or by unpacking a zip file
                    that you have provided them. Then they should be able build the application
                without extra configuration.</li>
                <li>You must start working on an existing project and adhere to a strict
                    set of conventions concerning where project libraries are stored
                    (and whether your build script accesses them with a relative reference
                or absolute reference). </li>
            </ul>

            <p>You can set a dedicated libraries folder for standard Java SE, Web, and
                Enterprise projects. You can set the libraries folder when you create the project
                (in the New Project wizard) or afterwards in the Libraries tab of the
            Project Properties dialog box.</p>

        <p>
            This section explains how to build standard projects in the IDE,
            how to do basic customizations to the build process, and how to
        handle compilation errors. </p>
        
        <div class="indent">
            <a name="building-commands"></a><h3 class="tutorial">Building Projects, Packages, and Files</h3>
            <p>Compilation in the IDE is simple. Assuming that your
                project's compilation classpath is set correctly, you need only
                select the project, package, or file that you want to compile and choose
            the appropriate Build or Compile command from the Run menu. The IDE then compiles the files.</p>
            <p>If the Compile on Save feature is enabled for a Java project
                (or the Deploy on Save feature
                is enabled for a Java web or enterprise project), the IDE compiles
                your files automatically when you
                save them. See
            <a href="#building-compile-on-save">Compile on Save</a> below for more information.</p>
            <p><b>To build your application for deployment:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose <tt>Run</tt> &gt; <tt>Clean and Build Project</tt>.
                    <p>Any previously compiled files and distributable outputs
                        such as JAR files are deleted. Then the files are recompiled
                        and new outputs are produced. A <code>build</code> folder is
                        created to hold the compiled classes. A <code>dist</code>
                        is generated to contain distributable outputs such as JAR files
                        and Javadoc documentation. You can see the build outputs
                by opening the Files window.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Whenever you invoke compile commands, the IDE displays the output including
                any compilation errors encountered in the Output window, as described in
            <a href="#building-fixing">Fixing Compilation Errors</a> below.</p>

            <a name="building-compile-on-save"></a><h3 class="tutorial">Compile on Save</h3>
            <p>The IDE's Compile on Save feature enables you to save time when you are running
                and debugging projects in the IDE. When the Compile on Save feature is enabled for
                a project, files are compiled when you save them. The compiled files are stored in
                a cache that the IDE uses when you run, test, debug, and profile the
                project in the IDE. This enables you to test and debug your application without having
            to wait for the application to be built first.</p>

            <p>When enabled, the Compile on Save feature has the following effects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The IDE
                    compiles your files as you save them so that your project is always
                ready to run or debug in the IDE.</li>
                <li>The Build command is disabled. If you want to rebuild the JAR file
                    without having to use the Clean and Build command, you need to disable
                the Save on Compile feature.</li>
                <li>The project's Ant script is not used when you use Run, Debug, Profile,
                    or Test commands. If you have customized your build script for any of
                these commands, those customizations will be disregarded.</li>
                <li>The JAR file that is built from the project is <i>not</i> kept
                    up to date when you save changes to your files. If you want to build or rebuild the JAR file, you
                    need to use the Clean and Build command. The Clean and Build command
                    always uses your project's Ant script, whether or not Compile on
                Save is enabled.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>By default, Compile on Save is enabled for new projects that you create. For
            existing projects, Compile on Save is turned off.</p>

            <p><b>To enable or disable Compile on Save for a Java project:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Right-click the project's node and choose Properties.</li>
                <li>Select the Compiling node and set the Compile on Save property.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Similarly, the IDE has a Deploy on Save feature for Java web and
                enterprise applications. When the Deploy on Save feature is enabled for a
                project and a project has been deployed to a server through the IDE,
                changed files are redeployed to the server immediately. For Deploy on Save
                to work on GlassFish V2, the Glassfish instance must have the
            Directory Deployment Enabled option selected. </p>
            <p><b>To enable or disable Deploy on Save for a Java web or enterprise project:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Right-click the project's node and choose Properties.</li>
                <li>Select the Run node and set the Deploy on Save property.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>To enable directory deployment Glassfish V2:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Choose <tt>Tools</tt> &gt; <tt>Servers</tt>.</li>
                <li>Select the server.</li>
                <li>Select the Options tab.</li>
                <li>Select the Directory Deployment Enabled option.</li>
            </ol>



            <a name="building-fixing"></a><h3 class="tutorial">Fixing Compilation Errors</h3>

            <!--TODO add info here about task list, etc.-->
            <p>
                The IDE displays output messages and any compilation errors in the
                Output Window. This multi-tabbed window is displayed automatically
                whenever you generate compilation errors, debug your program, generate
                Javadoc documentation, and so on. You can also open this window manually
            by choosing Window &gt; Output (Ctrl-4 on Windows/Cmd-4 on OS X).</p>
            <p>In addition, compilation errors are shown in the Tasks window and
            marked in the Source Editor.</p>
            <p>
                One important function of the Output window is to notify you of errors
                found while compiling your program. The error message is displayed in
                blue underlined text and is linked to the line in the source code that
                caused the error, as illustrated in the image below. The Output window
                also provides links to errors found when running Ant build scripts.
                Whenever you click an error link in the Output window, the Source Editor
                jumps to the line containing the error automatically.</p>
           	<p class="align-center"><a href="../../../images_www/articles/72/java/project-setup/output-window.png" rel="lytebox" title="Output window showing compilation errors">
					   <img src="../../../images_www/articles/72/java/project-setup/output-window-small.png" alt="Output window showing compilation errors" border=1></a></p>

            <p>Every action that is run by an Ant script, such as
                compiling, running, and debugging files, sends its output
                to the same Output window tab. If you need to save the
                messages displayed in the Output window, you can copy and
                paste it to a separate file. You can also set Ant to print the command
                output for each new target to a new Output window tab by choosing
                Tools &gt; Options, selecting the
                Miscellaneous category, clicking the Ant tab, and deselecting the checkbox for the
            Reuse Output Tabs from Finished Processes property.</p>
            <a name="building-filtering"></a><h3 class="tutorial">Filtering Output Files</h3>
            <p>
                When you create a JAR file or a WAR file, you usually want to include
                just the compiled <code>.class</code> files and any other
                resource files located in your source directory, such as
                resource bundles or XML documents. The default filter does
                this for you by excluding all <code>.java</code>, <code>.nbattrs</code>,
                and <code>.form</code>
            files from your output file.</p>
            <p>
                You can create additional filters using regular expressions to
                control the Output files. To specify which files to exclude,
                right-click your project in the Projects window and choose
                Properties to open the Project Properties dialog box.
                In the left pane, click on Packaging. In the right pane,
                enter regular expressions in the text box to specify the files
                to exclude when packaging the JAR or WAR files. In addition to the
            default expressions, here are some additional regular expressions you can use:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th class="tblheader" scope="col">Regular Expression</th>
                    <th class="tblheader" scope="col">Description</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="tbltd1"><code>&#92;.html$ </code></td>
                    <td class="tbltd1">Exclude all HTML files</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="tbltd1"><code>&#92;.java$ </code></td>
                    <td class="tbltd1">Exclude all Java files</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="tbltd1"><code>(&#92;.html$)|(&#92;.java$) </code></td>
                    <td class="tbltd1">Exclude all HTML and Java files</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="tbltd1"><code>(Key)|(&#92;.gif$) </code></td>
                    <td class="tbltd1">Exclude all GIF files and any files with <code>Key</code>
                    in their name</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <a name="deploy-projects"></a><h3 class="tutorial`">Running Projects and Files</h3>
            <p>For Java projects, you typically set the project that contains
                the program's main class as the main project. For web projects,
                the main project is the project that is first deployed. To run a
            project, package, or file, choose one of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the main menu, choose <tt>Run</tt> &gt; <tt>Run Main Project (F6)</tt>
                to run the main project. Alternatively, you can use the Run Main Project button in the toolbar.</li>
                <li>In the Projects window, right-click the project and choose Run 
                to run a project. Note that for Java projects, the project must have a main class.</li>
                <li>In the Projects window, right-click the file and choose Run File (Shift+F6)
                    to run a file. Alternatively, choose <tt>Run</tt> &gt; <tt>Run File</tt>  &gt; <tt>Run filename (Shift+F6)</tt>
                in the main menu to run a runnable class. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>When you run the project the IDE displays any compilation
                errors and output in the Output window. For more, see
            <a href="#building-fixing">Fixing Compilation Errors</a>.</p>
            <p class="notes"><b>Note:</b> If Compile on Save
                is enabled for a project, the Run Project command operates on class files
                that have been created when you have saved those files. The Ant
                build script is not used. If you have defined custom steps
                in the build script, those steps are not followed. If you would like
                the full build process to occur when you use Run Project, Debug Project,
                and Profile Project, disable <a href="#building-compile-on-save">Compile on Save</a>.

            <a name="deploy-options"></a><h3 class="tutorial">Customizing Runtime Options</h3>
            <p>By default, the IDE does not specify a main class, runtime arguments,
                or JVM arguments. The runtime classpath of each standard project
                contains the project's compiled classes and everything in the
                project's compilation classpath. You can view the project's compilation
                classpath by opening the Project Properties dialog box and selecting the
                Libraries node in the Categories pane and then clicking the Compile
            tab in the right pane.</p>
            <p>To change project runtime options, open the Project Properties
                dialog box by right-clicking the project node in the Projects
                window and choosing Properties. Next, select the Libraries node in
                the Categories pane and click the Run tab in the right pane of the
                dialog box. Note that to access settings for the main class,
                program arguments, the working directory for program execution and
                VM options, you have to select the Run node. In the next section
            we'll take a closer look at how to configure the runtime classpath.</p>

            <!-- TODO Run configurations-->
            <a name="deploy-classpath"></a><h3 class="tutorial">Setting the Runtime Classpath</h3>
            <p>To add projects, libraries, JAR files, and folders to the
                project's runtime classpath, use the buttons on the right side
            of the Run-time Libraries list in the Project Properties dialog box.</p>
            <p>If your project uses special libraries dynamically at
                runtime through an indirect interface or reflection
                (like JDBC drivers or JAXP implementations), you have to add
                these libraries to the runtime classpath. You also have to
                adjust your runtime classpath if the runtime dependencies
                between your projects do not match the compilation dependencies
                between the projects. For example, imagine that project A compiles
                against project B, and project B compiles against project C, but
                project A does not compile against project C. This means that
                project A only has project B on its runtime classpath. If
                project A requires both project B and project C during execution,
            you have to add project C to project A's runtime classpath.</p>

            <a name="deploy-args"></a><h3 class="tutorial">Setting the Main Class and Runtime Arguments</h3>
            <p>To set the project's main class, select the Run node in the Categories
                pane of the Project Properties dialog box and type the fully-qualified
                name in the Main Class field (for example,
                <code>org.myCompany.myLib.MyLibClass</code>). The main class must
                exist in the project or in one of the JAR files or libraries in
                the project's runtime classpath. Afterwards, type any necessary
            runtime arguments in the Arguments field.</p>
            <p>If you use the Browse button to choose the project main class,
                the file chooser only shows classes in your project source
                directory. If you want to specify a class in one the libraries
                on the classpath, you have to type the fully-qualified name of
            the class in the Main Class field.</p>
            <a name="deploy-jvm"></a><h3 class="tutorial">Setting JVM Arguments</h3>
            <p>You can specify JVM arguments for the project in the
                Project Properties dialog box. Open the Project Properties
                dialog box and click Run in the Categories pane and then type
            a space-separated list of JVM arguments in the VM Options field.</p>
            <p>You can set system properties by typing the following in the VM Options field:</p>
            <pre class="examplecode">-Dname=value</pre>
        </div>

        <a name="build-script"></a><h2>Customizing the Build Script</h2>
        <p>In standard projects the IDE generates the build script based on the options you
            enter in the New Project wizard and the project's Project Properties dialog box.
            You can set all the basic compilation and runtime options in the project's
            Project Properties dialog box and the IDE automatically updates your project's
            Ant script. If you have additional requirements for the build process
            that can not be handled in the Project Properties dialog box, you can
        modify the build script directly.</p>
        <p>The main Ant script for a standard project is <code>build.xml</code>.
            The IDE calls targets in <code>build.xml</code> whenever you run
            IDE commands. This file contains an
            import statement that imports <code>nbproject/build-impl.xml</code>,
            which contains build targets that are generated by the IDE.
            In <code>build.xml</code>, you can override any of the targets from <code>nbproject/build-impl.xml</code>
            or write new targets. Do <i>not</i> edit <code>nbproject/build-impl.xml</code> directly,
            because that file is regenerated based on changes that you make in
        the Project Properties dialog box.</p>
        <p>In addition, the build script uses the <code>nbproject/project.properties</code>
        which you can edit manually.</p>
        <p>With standard projects, you can customize the build process by doing
        any of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Entering basic options, like classpath settings and JAR filters,
                in the New Project wizard when you create a project, or afterwards
            in the Project Properties dialog box.</li>
            <li>Editing properties in <code>nbproject/project.properties</code>. This file
                stores Ant properties with important information about your project,
                such as the location of your source and output folders. You can override
                the properties in this file. Be careful when editing this file. For
                example, the output folder is deleted every time you clean your project.
                You should therefore never set the output folder to the same location as
                your source folder without first configuring the clean target to not
            delete the output folder.</li>
            <li>Customizing existing or creating new Ant targets by doing any
                of the following:<ul>
                    <li>Add instructions to be processed before or after an Ant
                        target is run. Each of the main targets in <code>nbproject/build-impl.xml</code>
                        also has a <code>-pre</code> and <code>-post</code> target that you
                        can override in <code>build.xml</code>. For example, to get RMI
                        working with regular projects, type the following in <code>build.xml</code>:
                        <pre class="examplecode">&lt;target name=&quot;-post-compile&quot;&gt;
  &lt;rmic base=&quot;${build.classes.dir}&quot; includes=&quot;**/Remote*.class&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;/target&gt;</pre></li>
                    <li>Change the instructions in an Ant target. Copy the target from <code>nbproject/build-impl.xml</code>
                        to <code>build.xml</code>
                    and make any changes to the target.</li>
                    <li>Create new targets in <code>build.xml</code>. You can also add
                        the new target to the dependencies of any of the IDE's
                        existing targets. Override the existing target in <code>build.xml</code>
                        and
                        then add the new target to the existing target's <code>depends</code> property.
                        For example, the following adds the <code>new-target</code>
                        target to the run target's dependencies:
                        <pre class="examplecode">&lt;target name=&quot;new-target&quot;&gt;
    &lt;!-- target body... --&gt;
&lt;/new-target&gt;
&nbsp;
                        &lt;target name=&quot;run&quot; depends=&quot;new-target,myprojname-impl.run&quot;/&gt;</pre>
                        <p>You do not need to copy the body of the run target into <code>build.xml</code>.</p>
        </li></ul></li></ul>

        a JAR file that you may find useful:</p>

            <p>The IDE automatically recognizes Ant scripts and displays them as Ant script nodes
                (<img src="../../../images_www/articles/72/java/project-setup/anticon.png" align="bottom" alt="Ant script node icon">
                ) rather than as normal XML files. You can right-click Ant scripts
                in the Projects window, Files window, or Favorites window to access a
                pop-up menu of commands. You can also expand the Ant script node to see an
                alphabetical list of subnodes representing the Ant script's targets. Each of
            these subnodes also has a popup menu of commands.</p>
            <p>In the Projects, Files, and Favorites windows, an Ant script's
            subnodes are flagged in the following ways:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th class="tblheader" scope="col">Icon</th>

                        These targets include a description attribute, which is displayed as a tooltip. You define the target's description attribute in the Source Editor.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

                    <td class="tbltd1">
                            <b>Normal Ant target.</b>
                        A target without a description attribute.
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Double-click any of the
                Ant script's subnodes to jump to that target's location in the Source Editor. All of
                the normal XML search tools, selection tools, and keyboard shortcuts are
                available for editing Ant scripts, and the IDE provides
            code completion for all standard Ant tasks.</p>
            <p>
                When you create a target that you want to run from the command line,
                give the target a description attribute. Then, if you forget the names
                of the targets or what they do, you can run the ant <code>-projecthelp &lt;script&gt;</code>
                command from the command line. With this command, Ant lists only
                those targets that have a description attribute, together with their
                descriptions. Especially when there are many targets in your Ant build script,
                emphasizing some and de-emphasizing others can be a useful way to
            distinguish between those that you use a lot and those that you use less often.</p>
            <p>The font style of a subnode's label in the Projects, Files, and Favorites
            windows indicates the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Normal.</b> A target that is defined within the current Ant script.</li>
                <li><b>Italics.</b> A target that is imported from another Ant script.</li>
                <li><b>Greyed out.</b> An internal target that cannot be run
                directly. Internal targets have names beginning with '-'.</li>
                <li><b>Bold.</b> The default target for the script, if there is one.
                    The default target is
                    declared as an attribute of the project, together with other project attributes,
                such as its name. You define the project's default attribute in the Source Editor.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Targets that are imported from another script but are overridden in the
            importing script are not listed. Only the overriding target is listed.</p>
            <p>You can run targets in an Ant script from the Ant script's node in the
                Projects window, Files window, or Favorites window. To do so,
                right-click the Ant script node and choose a target from the Run Target
                submenu. Targets are sorted alphabetically. Only emphasized targets are listed.
                Choose Other Targets to run a target that has not been emphasized with a
                description attribute. Internal targets are excluded from these lists
            because they cannot be run independently.</p>
            <p>Instead of running a target by using the Ant script node's popup menu,
            you can simply right-click the target's node and choose Run Target.</p>

            <a name="ant-custom-task"></a><h3 class="tutorial">Writing Custom Ant Tasks</h3>
            <p>You can use custom Ant tasks to expand on the functionality provided by
                Ant's built-in tasks. Custom tasks are often used to define properties,
                create nested elements, or write text directly between tags using the <code>addText</code>
            method.</p>
            <p><b>To create a custom Ant task in the IDE:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Right-click the package where you would like to place the task
                and choose <tt>New</tt> &gt; <tt>Other</tt>.</li>
                <li>Select the Other category and the Custom Ant Task file type.</li>
                <li>Complete the wizard.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>When you create the
                custom Ant task file, the template opens in the Source Editor. The template
                contains sample code for many of the common operations performed by Ant tasks.
            After each section of code, the template also shows you how to use the task in an Ant script.</p>
