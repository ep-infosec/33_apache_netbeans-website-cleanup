        <h1>Working with CSS Style Sheets in an HTML5 Application</h1>

        <p>NetBeans IDE 7.3 introduces a new project type to help you develop HTML5 applications. 
        HTML5 applications typically combine HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create applications 
        that are run in a browser and that are displayed on a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets and laptops.
        This document demonstrates how the IDE provides tools that can help you work with CSS rules to modify the layout of
        an application.</p>
        
        <p>The NetBeans Connector extension for the Chrome browser can help you view applications as they would
        appear on various devices. 
        The extension enables the Chrome browser and the IDE to communicate with each other.
        The Inspect in NetBeans mode can help you locate elements in your source code by selecting them in the browser.
        After you select an element in the browser you can use the IDE to view the CSS rules and properties 
        that are applied to that element.
        </p>
        
        <p>For details on how to install the NetBeans Connector extension for the Chrome browser,
            see the tutorial <a href="html5-gettingstarted.html">Getting Started with HTML5 Applications</a>.</p>

        <a name="createproject"></a>
        <h2>Creating the HTML5 Application</h2>
        <p>In this tutorial you use a site template to create the HTML5 project.
            The site template that you use in this tutorial is the same template that was saved as a site template in the
            <a href="html5-gettingstarted.html">Getting Started with HTML5 Applications</a> tutorial.
            If you performed the steps in the Getting Started tutorial you can use the site template that you saved 
            in the last section. Alternatively, you can download the HTML5DemoSiteTemplate.zip site template.</p>
        
        <p>Perform the following steps to create the application from a site template.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Download the HTML5 site template (<a href="https://netbeans.org/projects/samples/downloads/download/Samples/Web%20Client/HTML5DemoSiteTemplate.zip">HTML5DemoSiteTemplate</a>)</li>
            <li>Choose File &gt; New Project (Ctrl-Shift-N; &#8984;-Shift-N on Mac) in the main menu to open the New Project wizard.</li>
            <li>Select the <strong>HTML/JavaScript</strong> category and
                then select <strong>HTML5 Application</strong>. Click Next.</li>
            <li>Type <strong>HTML5DemoCss</strong> for the project name and specify a location. Click Next.</li>
            <li>Select the <strong>Select Template</strong> option and click Browse to locate the site template (<tt>HTML5DemoSiteTemplate.zip</tt>). Click Finish. <br>
            <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/web/html5-css/html5-css-newproject.png"
                    class="margin-around b-all" alt="screenshot of New HTML5 Application wizard"
                    title="Specify the site templat in the New HTML5 Application wizard">
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>When you click Finish the IDE creates the project and opens the <tt>index.html</tt> file in the editor.
        In the Projects window you can see that the project contains <tt>index.html</tt>, a CSS style sheet, 
        some JavaScript libraries and some images. 
        The CSS Rules and Navigator windows also open in the IDE.</p>

        
<!-- ++++++++++++++++ Viewing the Application ++++++++++++++++ -->
        <a name="viewing"></a>
        <h2>Viewing the Application on Different Devices</h2>
        <p>In this tutorial you will run the application in the Chrome browser with the NetBeans Connector extension installed. 
            When the extension is installed you can use the NetBeans menu in the browser to easily resize the browser 
            window to view the application as it would appear on some common devices. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="notes"><strong>Notes.</strong>
                For this tutorial it is recommended that you use the Chrome browser and install the NetBeans extension for Chrome.
                See the tutorial <a href="html5-gettingstarted.html">Getting Started with HTML5 Applications</a>
                for details on how to install the NetBeans Connector extension.</p>
        
            <p>Perform the following steps to run the application in the Chrome browser.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Confirm that Chrome with NetBeans Integration is selected in the dropdown list in the Toolbar.
                </li>
            <li>Click the Run button in the toolbar to run the project in the Chrome browser. 
                
                <p>In the browser you can see a simple expandable menu.</p>
                <p>You will notice that there is a yellow bar in the browser tab that notifies
                you that the NetBeans Connector is debugging the tab.
                The IDE and the browser are connected and are able to communicate with each other when the yellow bar is visible.
                When you launch an HTML5 application from the IDE the JavaScript debugger is automatically enabled.
                When you save changes to a file or make changes to a CSS style sheet you do not need to reload the page 
                because the browser window is automatically updated to display the changes.</p>

                <p class="alert">If you close the yellow bar or click Cancel you will break the connection
                between the IDE and the browser. 
                If you break the connection you will need to launch the HTML5 application from the IDE.</p>
                
                <p>You will also notice that the NetBeans icon is visible in the URL location field of the browser.
                You can click the icon to open a menu that provides various options for changing the display size of the browser
                and for enabling the Inspect in NetBeans mode.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Click the Open NetBeans Action icon in the URL field of the browser to open the NetBeans menu 
                and select Tablet Portrait in the menu. 
                <p>The window resizes to the size of a tablet browser in portrait mode.
                The menu stretches to fill the right side and the entire menu is visible.</p>
            <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/web/html5-css/html5-css-tabletbrowser1.png"
                    class="margin-around b-all" alt="screenshot of browser in Tablet Portrait view"
                    title="Tablet Portrait display size in the browser">
            <p>If you select one of the default devices in the menu the browser window will 
            resize to the dimensions of the device. This enables you to see how the 
            application will look on the selected device.
            HTML5 applications are usually designed to respond to the size of the screen
            of the device on which they are viewed. 
            You can use JavaScript and CSS rules that respond to the screen size and
            modify how the application is displayed so that the layout is optimized for the
            device. </p></li>
            
            <li>Click the NetBeans icon again and select Smartphone Landscape
                in the NetBeans menu. <br>
                <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/web/html5-css/html5-css-tabletbrowser2.png"
                    class="margin-around b-all" alt="screenshot of NetBeans menu in browser"
                    title="Select Smartphone Landscape in the NetBeans menu in the browser">
                <p>The window resizes to the size of a smartphone in landscape orientation and you
                    can see that the bottom part of the menu is not visible without scrolling.</p>
            <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/web/html5-css/html5-css-smartphonebrowser1.png"
                    class="margin-around b-all" alt="screenshot of browser window resized to Smartphone Landscape"
                    title="Browser window resized to Smartphone Landscape"></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>In the next section you will modify the style sheet so that it is possible to view the entire menu
        without scrolling on a smartphone in landscape view.</p>
            
            
            
<!-- ++++++++++++++++ Modifying the Application Layout ++++++++++++++++ -->
        <a name="layout"></a>
        <h2>Modifying the Layout</h2>
            
        <p>It should be possible to make some minor changes to the elements of the page
        so that no scrolling is required. These changes should be applied only when
        the size of the browser is the size of a smartphone or smaller. 
        When oriented in landscape view, the browser window of a smartphone is 480 pixels wide and 320 pixels high.</p>
        
        <div class="indent">
<!-- ++++++++++++++++ Media Style Sheet ++++++++++++++++ -->
        <a name="newstylesheet"></a>
        <h3>Create a Media Style Sheet</h3>
        <p>In this exercise you will create a new style sheet and add a media rule for devices that
            have smartphone displays.
        You will then add some CSS Rules to the media rule.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Right-click the <tt>css</tt> folder node in the Projects window and choose New &gt; Cascading Style Sheet in the popup menu.</li>
            <li>Type <strong>mycss</strong> as the File Name. Click Finish.
                <p>When you click Finish the new style sheet opens in the editor.</p></li>
            <li>Add the following media rule to the style sheet.
                <pre class="examplecode">/*My rule for smartphone*/
@media (max-width: 480px) {

}</pre>
                <p>Any CSS rules that you add between the brackets for this rule will only be
                applied when the dimension of the browser is 480 pixels wide or less.</p>
                <p class="tips">Create code templates for code snippets that you might use frequently.
                You can create CSS code templates in the Code Templates tab in the Editor category
                of the Options window.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Save your changes.</li>
            <li>Open <tt>index.html</tt> in the editor.</li>
            <li>Add the following link to the style sheet between the <tt>&lt;head&gt;</tt> tags in <tt>index.html</tt>. Save your changes.
                <pre class="examplecode">&lt;link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="css/mycss.css"&gt;</pre>
                <p class="tips">You can use code completion in the editor to help you add the link to the style sheet.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <a name="addrules"></a>
        <h3>Adding CSS Rules</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Chrome browser, click the NetBeans icon and select Inspect in NetBeans Mode in the menu.</li>
            <li>Click the image in the browser.
                <p>An element is highlighted when it is selected in Inspect mode.
                In this screenshot you can see that the image is highlighted in blue.</p>
            <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/web/html5-css/html5-css-selectimage.png"

                    title="Image selected in Chrome browser">
            <p>In the IDE you can see that the CSS rules and properties 
                that apply to <tt>img</tt> are listed in the CSS Styles window.
            The Selection tab of the CSS Styles window has three panes that provide details about the
            selected element.</p>
            <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/web/html5-css/html5-css-styleswindow1.png"

                    title="CSS Styles window when image is selected" style="float:left;">
            <h4>Upper Pane</h4>
            <p>
            In the upper Properties pane of the window you can see that 
            six property-value pairs are applied to the <tt>img</tt> element.
            Three of the pairs (<tt>border</tt>, <tt>float</tt> and <tt>margin</tt>) are applied via
            a CSS rule for the <tt>img</tt> element. 
            The remaining three pairs are applied because the <tt>img</tt> element inherits
            the properties of class selectors that are applied to objects that contain the <tt>img</tt> element.
            You can clearly see the structure of the DOM in the Navigator window.
            The <tt>border</tt> property is currently selected in the Properties pane.
                of the CSS Styles window. 
            </p>
            <h4>Middle Pane</h4>
            <p>In the middle Applied Styles pane you can see that
                the <tt>border</tt> property and value is specified in a CSS rule that defines the <tt>img</tt> element.
                The rule is located on line 12 in the <tt>basecss.css</tt> file. 
                You can click the location in the pane to open the style sheet in the editor.</p>
            
            <h4>Lower Pane</h4>
            <p>The lower pane displays all the properties that are defined
                in the CSS rule for the rule that is selected in the middle pane. 
                In this case you can see that the rule for <tt>img</tt> defines the <tt>border</tt>, <tt>float</tt>
                and <tt>margin-right</tt> properties.</p>

            The new rule is now listed in the Applied Styles pane.
            You can see that there are two CSS rules for <tt>img</tt>.
            One of the rules is located in <tt>mycss.css</tt> and one is located

        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

        <p>In this tutorial, you learned how to add and modify the CSS rules of an HTML5 application
        to improve how the application is displayed on a device with a smaller screen size.
        You viewed the application in a browser that was resized to that of a standard smartphone.
        You used the Inspect in NetBeans Mode in the Chrome browser to help you locate
        CSS style rules and then modified the rules to optimize the layout for a smaller screen size.</p>
