        <h1>Debugging and Testing JavaScript in an HTML5 Application</h1>

        <p>NetBeans IDE 7.3 introduces a new project type to help you develop HTML5 applications. 
        HTML5 applications typically combine HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create applications 
        that are run in a browser and that are displayed on a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets and laptops.
        This document demonstrates how the IDE provides tools that can help you debug and test
        JavaScript files in the IDE.</p>
        
        <p>When you want to debug the JavaScript files in your HTML5 application it is
        recommended that you install the NetBeans Connector extension for the Chrome browser.
        Debugging is enabled automatically when you run the application in the browser
        and the extension is installed.</p>
        <p>The IDE also enables you to easily configure and run unit tests on JavaScript files
        using the Jasmine testing framework and the JS Test Driver server. 
        You can configure JS Test Driver to run unit tests against a variety of browsers
        and you can quickly specify the JavaScript libraries, scripts and tests that you
        want the IDE to load when running the tests.
        When a test fails you can use the debugger to help you locate the problematic code.
        </p>
        
        <p class="tips">For details on how to install the NetBeans Connector extension for the Chrome browser,
            see the tutorial <a href="html5-gettingstarted.html">Getting Started with HTML5 Applications</a>.</p>

        <a name="createproject"></a>
        <h2>Creating the HTML5 Sample Application</h2>
        <p>Perform the following steps to create the HTML5 sample application from a site template.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose File &gt; New Project (Ctrl-Shift-N; &#8984;-Shift-N on Mac) in the main menu to open the New Project wizard.</li>
            <li>Expand the <strong>Samples</strong> node in the New Project wizard and 
                select the <strong>HTML5</strong> category.</li>
            <li>Select the <strong>AngularJS Phone Catalog Tutorial</strong> project. Click Next.<br>
            <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/web/html5-js/html5-js-newproject.png"
                    class="margin-around b-all" alt="screenshot of Sample project in New File wizard"
                    title="AngularJS Phone Catalog Tutorial sample project in New File wizard">

            </li>
            <li>Specify a location for the project. Click Finish.
        
            <p>When you click Finish the IDE creates the project and opens the <tt>index.html</tt> file in the editor.
            In the Projects window you can see that the project contains <tt>index.html</tt> and various CSS style sheets 
            and JavaScript files and libraries. </p>
            <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/web/html5-js/html5-js-projectswindow.png"
            class="margin-around b-all" alt="screenshot of project nodes in Projects window"
            title="AngularJS Phone Catalog Tutorial project nodes in Projects window">
            
            <p>The project also includes several JavaScript unit test and configuration files  
            that were generated by default. </p></li>
            <li>Confirm that Chrome with NetBeans Integration is selected in the dropdown list in the toolbar.<br>
            <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/web/html5-js/html5-js-selectbrowser.png"
        class="margin-around b-all" alt="screenshot of dropdown list in toolbar"
        title="Browser selected in dropdown list in toolbar"></li>
            <li>Click the Run button in the toolbar (F6) or right-click the project node in the
                Projects window and choose Run. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>When you Run the project the front page of the HTML5 application opens in the Chrome browser
        and you can see a list of mobile phones.
        When you click the name of a mobile phone the page displays the phone details.</p>
        <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/web/html5-js/html5-js-runproject1.png"
        class="margin-around b-all" alt="screenshot of application in the browser window"
        title="AngularJS Phone Catalog Tutorial application in the browser window">
        
        <p>You will notice that there is a yellow bar in the browser tab that notifies
        you that the NetBeans Connector is debugging the tab.
        The IDE and the browser are connected and are able to communicate with each other when the yellow bar is visible.
        When you launch an HTML5 application from the IDE the JavaScript debugger is automatically enabled.
        When you save changes to a file or make changes to a CSS style sheet you do not need to reload the page 
        because the browser window is automatically updated to display the changes.</p>

        <p class="alert">If you close the yellow bar or click Cancel you will break the connection
        between the IDE and the browser. 
        If you break the connection you will need to run the HTML5 application from the IDE again
        to use JavaScript debugger.</p>

        <p>You will also notice that the NetBeans icon is visible in the URL location field of the browser.
        You can click the icon to open a menu that provides various options for changing the display size of the browser
        and for enabling the Inspect in NetBeans mode.</p>
        
<!-- ++++++++++++++++ Using the JavaScript Debugger ++++++++++++++++ -->

<a name="debugger"></a>
<h2>Using the JavaScript Debugger</h2>
<p>In this exercise you will place a breakpoint in a JavaScript file and run the application.
You can use the tooltip in the editor to quickly see the values of variables.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Expand the <tt>js</tt> node in the Projects window and double-click <tt>controllers.js</tt> 
    to open the file in the editor.</li>
    <li>Place a line breakpoint on line 16 in <tt>controllers.js</tt> by clicking in the left margin. <br>

        class="margin-around b-all" alt="screenshot of breakpoints in Breakpoints window"
        title="List of breakpoints in Breakpoints window">
    
    </li>

    <li>Click the Run button in the toolbar to run the project again. 
    <p>When you run the project you will see the same page because the breakpoint that you set was not hit.</p></li>

    <li>In the browser, click one of the entries in the page, for example, Motorola Atrix4G. 

        <p>You will see that the page is partially loaded but that the data for the phone is missing
            because the data has not been passed to the JavaScript and rendered.</p>
    <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/web/html5-js/html5-js-break-details.png"
        class="margin-around b-all" alt="screenshot of details page in browser"
        title="Details page of the application is partially loaded in the browser">
    </li>

    <li>In the editor in the IDE you can see that the breakpoint was hit and that
    the Program Counter is currently in line 16 of <tt>controllers.js</tt>.</li>
    <li>Hover your cursor over the <tt>phone</tt> variable to view a tooltip with information 
        about the variable.<br> 
    <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/web/html5-js/html5-js-variables1.png"
        class="margin-around b-all" alt="screenshot of variables tooltip in editor"
        title="Variables tooltip in editor">

    <p>In the tooltip you can see the following information: <tt>phone = (Resource) Resource</tt>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Click the tooltip to expand the tooltip and view a list of the variables and values.<br> 

        <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/web/html5-js/html5-js-variables.png"
        class="margin-around b-all" alt="screenshot of expanded variables tooltip in editor"
        title="Expanded variables tooltip in editor">
        <p>For example, when you expand the <tt>android</tt> node you can see the values of the strings 
            <tt>os</tt> and <tt>ui</tt>.</p> 
        <p class="tips">You can also choose Window &gt; Debugging &gt; Variables to 
            view the list in the Variables window.</p></li>

    <li>Use the step buttons in the toolbar to step through the JavaScript functions in the <tt>angular.js</tt> library 
    or click the Continue button (F5) to resume the application. </li>
</ol>
    

<!-- ++++++++++++++++ Running JS Unit Tests ++++++++++++++++ -->
<a name="unittest"></a>
<h2>Running JS Unit Tests</h2>
<p>The IDE enables you to easily configure the JS Test Driver server to run your unit tests. 
In this tutorial you will use the JavaScript unit tests that are included with
the sample project and use the Jasmine testing framework.
</p>

<p>The JS Test Driver is a server that provides a URL that is
the target for running JavaScript unit tests.
When you run your tests the server starts and waits to run the tests.
You will see a green status message in the browser window that confirms that the
server is running and waiting.
The IDE provides a configuration dialog for JS Test Driver that you can open from 
the JS Test Driver node in the Services.
The configuration dialog enables you to easily specify the location of of the
JS Test Driver server JAR and the browsers that you want to run tests against.
The JS Test Driver node enables you to quickly see if the server is running and to 
start and stop the server.</p>

<p>For more details on configuring the JS Test Driver server,
    see the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/wiki/GettingStarted">Getting Started with JsTestDriver</a> documentation.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Download the
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/">JS Test Driver JAR</a>
        and save the JAR to your local system.</li>
    <li>In the Services window, right-click the JS Test Driver node and choose Configure. <br>
    <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/web/html5-js/html5-js-testdriver-serviceswindow.png"
        class="margin-around b-all" alt="screenshot of Configure jsTest Driver node in Services window"
        title="Configure jsTest Driver node in Services window"></li>
    <li>In the Configure dialog box, click Browse and locate the JS Test Driver JAR that you downloaded.</li>
    <li>Select the Chrome with NetBeans JS Debugger option. Click OK.<br>
    <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/web/html5-js/html5-js-testdriver-configure.png"
        class="margin-around b-all" alt="screenshot of Configure jsTest Driver dialog box"
        title="Configure jsTest Driver dialog box">
    <p class="notes"><strong>Note.</strong> You only need to specify the location of the JS Test Driver JAR 
        the first time that you configure the JS Test Driver.</p>
        
    <p>The list of browsers that can be captured and used for testing is based on the browsers that
        are installed on your system.
        You can select multiple browsers as slave browsers, but to run the tests
        a window that can be a slave for the server must be open for each browser.
        The selected browsers will be captured automatically when you start the server from the IDE.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Right-click the project node in the Projects window and choose New &gt; Other.</li>
    <li>Select the <strong>jsTestDriver Configuration File</strong> in the Unit Tests category. Click Next.</li>
    <li>Confirm that <strong>jsTestDriver</strong> is the File Name.</li>
    <li>In the Created File field, confirm that the location for the file is 
        the <tt>config</tt> folder of the project (<tt>AngularJSPhoneCat/config/jsTestDriver.conf</tt>).
        <p class="notes"><strong>Note.</strong>
            The <tt>jsTestDriver.conf</tt> configuration file must be in the <tt>config</tt> folder of the project. 
            If the location for the created file is not the <tt>config</tt> folder, 
            click Browse and select <tt>AngularJSPhoneCat - Configuration Files</tt> folder in the dialog box.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Confirm that the checkbox for downloading the Jasmine libraries is selected. Click Finish.<br>
    <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/web/html5-js/html5-js-testdriver-configfile.png"

        title="New jsTestDriver Configuration File wizard">
    
        <p class="notes"><strong>Note.</strong>You need to download the Jasmine libraries to run jsTestDriver. 
            If you are notified that the IDE is unable to download the Jasmine libraries,
            check the proxy settings of the IDE in the Options window.</p>

        <p>When you click Finish the IDE generates a skeleton <tt>jsTestDriver.conf</tt> configuration file
        and opens the file in the editor. In the Projects window you can see that the configuration
        file is created under the Configuration Files node. If you expand the <tt>lib</tt>
        folder under the Unit Tests node you can see that the Jasmine libraries were added to the project.</p>

        <p>The configuration file specifies the default location of the local server that is 
        used to run the tests.
        The file also lists the files that must be loaded. 
        By default the list includes the Jasmine libraries and any JavaScript files that 
        are in the <tt>unit</tt> folder.
        Tests are usually located in the <tt>unit</tt> folder but you can modify the list to 
        specify the locations of other files that need to be loaded to run the tests.</p>
        <p>The <tt>unit</tt> folder of the AngularJS Phone Catalog Tutorial project contains 
            four JavaScript files with unit tests.</p>

        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

        <p>In this tutorial you learned how the IDE provides tools that can help you
            debug and run unit tests on JavaScript files. 
            Debugging is automatically enabled for HTML5 applications when you run 
        the application in the Chrome browser and the NetBeans Connector extension is enabled.
        The IDE also enables you to easily configure and run unit tests on JavaScript files
        using the Jasmine testing framework and the JS Test Driver server.</p>
