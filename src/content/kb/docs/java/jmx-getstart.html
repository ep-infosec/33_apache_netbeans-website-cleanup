<h3>Software Needed for the Tutorial</h3>
<p>For this tutorial you need to have the following software installed on your computer:</p>
<table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th class="tblheader" scope="col">Software or Resource</th>
        <th class="tblheader" scope="col">Version Required</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tbltd1"><a href="https://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html">NetBeans IDE</a></td>
        <td class="tbltd1">7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 8.0, Java bundle</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tbltd1"><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java Development Kit (JDK)</a></td>
        <td class="tbltd1">version 7 or 8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tbltd1">JMX plugin</td>
        <td class="tbltd1">Available from NetBeans Update Center</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tbltd1">JConsole plugin</td>
        <td class="tbltd1">Available from NetBeans Update Center</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>To install the <strong>JMX</strong> and <strong>JConsole</strong> plugins, choose Tools &gt; Plugins and download the modules from the NetBeans Update Center.</p>

<h2>Accessing the JMX Wizards</h2>
<p>After you have installed the JMX plugin and your project is open, you can access the JMX wizard by choose File &gt; New File (Ctrl-N) and selecting the JMX category.
You can then choose among the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Management Configuration File.</b> A standard Java properties file to 
    store your configuration for your JMX management, in particular for remote
    connection and security.</li>
    
  <li><b>Several types of JMX MBeans.</b> An MBean can represent a device, an application, or any 
    resource that needs to be managed. MBeans expose a management interface: a 
    set of readable and/or writable attributes and a set of invokable operations, 
    along with a self-description. The management interface does not change throughout 
    the life of an MBean instance. MBeans can also emit notifications when certain 
    defined events occur. JMX MBeans need to be registered into an MBean Server.</li>

  <li><b>JMX Manager.</b> A JMX Manager is any application that connects to a 
    remote JMX MBean Server.<br/>

 alt="screenshot of JMX New File Wizards" title="New File Wizards in JMX category"
class="margin-around b-all" /></li>
</ul>


<h2>Updating MBeans</h2>
<p>You can add attributes and operations to your MBeans with the JMX contextual
menu actions, which will popup a dialog box.
You can also have your MBeans implement the <tt>NotificationEmitter</tt> interface.</p>

<p>To update an MBean, either select the MBean class Java file in the Project tree and access 
  the JMX popup menu by right-clicking on the node,
  or simply right-click in the editor's window where your MBean class Java file 
is opened and access the JMX popup menu.</p>
  
  <p>These actions are demonstrated in  
  Exercise 3 of the <a href="jmx-tutorial.html#Exercise_3">
  Adding JMX Instrumentation to a Java Application</a> tutorial.</p>
  
<h2>Registering MBeans</h2>

<p>To remotely connect to your MBeans and manage your application, your MBeans
need to be registered into an MBean Server.</p>
<p>An MBean Server is the main central piece of the JMX technology. It keeps reference
of all MBean registered into it, can send notifications of new MBean registration or 
deletion, and can accept remote connections to expose attributes and operations
of its registered MBeans. If you are not familiar with MBean Server role, 
read the <tt>
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/management/MBeanServer.html">
javax.management.MBeanServer</a></tt> API documentation.</p>

<p>Starting with JDK 5, the Java Platform provides a default
MBean Server, called the Platform MBean Server.
It enables you to monitor the JVM, but you can also use it to register your own MBeans into it.
For details on the Java Platform MBean Server, read the <tt>
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/management/ManagementFactory.html">
    java.lang.management.ManagementFactory
</a></tt> API documentation.</p>

<p>Depending on its logic, determine where in your application code you want
your MBeans to be registered, typically in the initialization phase of your Main
class. Right-Click in your editor's window at the location where you want the 
MBean's registration code to be generated,
select the JMX submenu and then the 
&quot;Generate MBean Registration...&quot; action.</p>
  
    <p>This action is demonstrated in  
  Exercise 5 of the <a href="jmx-tutorial.html#Exercise_5">
  Adding JMX Instrumentation to a Java Application</a> tutorial.</p>

    
    
<h2>Implementing and Executing Manageable Applications</h2>

<p>JConsole is a JMX-compliant graphical tool for monitoring a Java virtual machine. 
JConsole can monitor both local and remote JVMs and can be used to monitor and 
manage JMX applications.</p>

<p>Typically, the work flow of implementing and executing manageable applications 
is as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Generate your MBeans. </li>
  <li>Add implementation to your MBeans </li>
  <li>Generate MBean's registration code.</li>
  <li>Run or debug your project with JConsole.</li>
</ol> 

<p>After you install the JMX and JConsole plugins you will see that the following buttons are added to the toolbar. 
    The actions are also accessible under the Debug menu item in the main menu.</p>
<table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th class="tblheader" scope="col">Button</th>
        <th class="tblheader" scope="col">Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tbltd1"><img alt="Run Main Project with Monitoring and Management button in the toolbar"

 src="../../../images_www/articles/74/java/jmx/debug-project24.png" class="margin-around" /></td>
        <td class="tbltd1">Debug Main Project with Monitoring and Management</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tbltd1"><img alt="Start JConsole Management Console button in the toolbar"

        <td class="tbltd1">Start JConsole Management Console</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p class="notes"><strong>Note.</strong> JConsole is part of the Java Platform and can be used independently from the IDE.

<h2>Running the Sample Application</h2>

<p>The JMX module includes a sample application with JMX monitoring built into it.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose File &gt; New Project.</li>
  <li>In Samples, select the JMX category.</li>
  <li>Select the Anagram Game Managed with JMX project. <br/>
  <img

 src="../../../images_www/articles/74/java/jmx/jmx-newproject.png"
class="margin-around b-all" width="600" />
 </li>
 
  <li>Click Next. There is no need to change the supplied default project name or
  location values. Confirm that the Set as Main Project checkbox is selected. Click Finish.
  <p class="notes"><strong>Notes.</strong> The IDE might prompt you to install the JUnit libraries if you did not install
  the JUnit plugin previously. You can click Resolve in the Resolve Resource Problems dialog box to 
  launch the Installer to install the JUnit plugin. Alternatively, you can install the JUnit plugin
  in the Plugins manager.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Once your project is created, and set as the Main Project, 
  Run it with JConsole by clicking the 
  &quot;Run Main Project with Monitoring and Management&quot; JConsole button.
  <p class="notes"><strong>Notes.</strong> You might see a Connection Failed warning in the 
      Java Monitoring &amp; Management Console when the console attempts to connect to the Anagram Game process. 
  For this tutorial you can click Insecure when you are prompted to authorize the connection.</p>
  
  <p>Clicking this button launches and displays the Anagram Game:</p>
  <img alt="Anagram Game" title="Anagram Game"
 src="../../../images_www/articles/74/java/jmx/jmx-anagram.png"
 class="margin-around b-all" />
  
  <p>The JConsole window is also displayed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>In the JConsole window, select the MBeans tab and in the tree layout 
  on the left open down all nodes under <tt>anagrams.toy.com</tt> 
  as shown below.<br/>

class="margin-around b-all" />
  </li>
  <li>Select the Notifications node and click on the Subscribe button at the 
  bottom so that JConsole will receive a new notification each time an anagram is solved.</li>
  <li>Now go to the Anagrams Game window, and solve the first three or four anagrams 
  (The answers are in the WordLibrary class, but here they are:
  abstraction, ambiguous, arithmetic, backslash, ...)</li>
  <li>Go back to JConsole, and notice that it received the four notifications.</li>
  <li>Click on the Attributes node and notice the attributes values are updated: <br/>
