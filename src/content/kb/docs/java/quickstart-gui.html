      <p>The IDE's GUI Builder makes it possible to build professional-looking GUIs 
         without an intimate understanding of layout managers. You can lay out your forms 
      by simply placing components where you want them. </p>

         <h3 class="tutorial">Creating a Project </h3>
         <p>Because all Java development in the IDE takes place within projects, we first 
            need to create a new <tt>ContactEditor</tt> project within which to store sources and 
            other project files. An IDE project is a group of Java source files plus its 
            associated meta data, including project-specific properties files, an Ant 
            build script that controls the build and run settings, and a <tt>project.xml</tt> file 
            that maps Ant targets to IDE commands. While Java applications often consist 
            of several IDE projects, for the purposes of this tutorial, we will build 
         a simple application which is stored entirely in a single project. </p>
         <table width="91%">
            <tr> 
               <td>
                  <p>To create a new <tt>ContactEditor</tt> application project: </p>
                  <ol>
                     <li>Choose File &gt; New Project. Alternately, you can click the New 
                     Project icon in the IDE toolbar. </li>
                     <li>In the Categories pane, select the Java node and in the Projects 
                     pane, choose Java Application. Click Next.</li>
                     <li> Enter <tt>ContactEditor</tt> in the Project Name field and specify the project 
                     location.</li>
                    <li>Leave the Use Dedicated Folder for Storing Libraries checkbox unselected.               </li>

                     Create Main Class field. </li>
                     <li>Click Finish. 
                        <p>
                           The IDE creates the <tt>ContactEditor</tt> folder on your system 
                           in the designated location. This folder contains all of the project's 
                           associated files, including its Ant script, folders for storing 
                           sources and tests, and a folder for project-specific metadata. To 
                        view the project structure, use the IDE's Files window. </p>

         <h3 class="tutorial">Creating a JFrame Container</h3>
         <p>After creating the new application, you may have noticed that the Source 
            Packages folder in the Projects window contains an empty <tt>&lt;default package&gt;</tt> 
            node. To proceed with building our interface, we need to create a Java container 
            within which we will place the other required GUI components. In this step 
            we'll create a container using the <tt>JFrame</tt> component and place the 
         container in a new package.</p>

                  <ol>
                     <li>In the Projects window, right-click the <tt>ContactEditor</tt> node and choose 
                     New &gt; JFrame Form. <br>
                     Alternatively, you can find a JFrame form by choosing New &gt; Other &gt; Swing GUI Forms &gt; JFrame Form. </li>
                     <li>Enter <tt>ContactEditorUI</tt> as the Class Name. </li>
                     <li>Enter <tt>my.contacteditor</tt> as the package.</li>
                     <li>Click Finish. 
                        <p> The IDE creates the <tt>ContactEditorUI</tt> form and the <tt>ContactEditorUI</tt> 
                           class within the <tt>ContactEditorUI.java</tt> application and opens 
                           the <tt>ContactEditorUI</tt> form in the GUI Builder. Notice that 
                           the <tt>my.contacteditor</tt> package replaces the default package.

      <h2>Getting Familiar with the GUI Builder</h2>
      <p>Now that we've set up a new project for our application, let's take a minute 
      to familiarize ourselves with the GUI Builder's interface. </p>
      <p class="notes"><b>Note:</b> To explore the GUI Builder interface with an interactive demo, view the <a  name="explore" href="http://bits.netbeans.org/media/quickstart-gui-explore.swf">Exploring GUI Builder (.swf)</a> screencast.</p>

                     alt="The IDE's GUI Builder Interface" border=1></a></p>
      
      <p>When we added the JFrame container, the IDE opened the newly-created <tt>ContactEditorUI</tt> 
         form in an Editor tab with a toolbar containing several buttons, as shown in 
         the preceding illustration. The ContactEditor form opened in the GUI Builder's 
         Design view and three additional windows appeared automatically along the IDE's 
         edges, enabling you to navigate, organize, and edit GUI forms as you build them. 
      </p>
      <p>The GUI Builder's various windows include: </p>
      <ul>
         <li><b>Design Area. </b>The GUI Builder's primary window for creating and editing 
            Java GUI forms. The toolbar's Source button enables you 
            to view a class's source code, the Design  button  allows you to view a graphical view of the GUI components, the History button allows you to access the local history of changes of the  file. The 
            additional toolbar buttons provide convenient access to common commands, such 
            as choosing between Selection and Connection modes, aligning components, setting 
         component auto-resizing behavior, and previewing forms. </li>
         <li><b>Navigator. </b>Provides a representation of all the components, both 
            visual and non-visual, in your application as a tree hierarchy. The Navigator 
            also provides visual feedback about what component in the tree is currently 
            being edited in the GUI Builder as well as allows you to organize components 
         in the available panels. </li>
         <li><b>Palette. </b>A customizable list of available components containing tabs 
            for JFC/Swing, AWT, and JavaBeans components, as well as layout managers. 
            In addition, you can create, remove, and rearrange the categories displayed 
         in the Palette using the customizer. </li>
         <li><b>Properties Window. </b>Displays the properties of the component currently 
            selected in the GUI Builder, Navigator window, Projects window, or Files window.         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you click the Source button, the IDE displays the application's Java source 
      code in the Editor with sections of code that are automatically generated by 
      the GUI Builder indicated by grey areas (they become blue when selected), called Guarded Blocks. Guarded blocks 
      are protected areas that are not editable in Source view. You can only edit 
      code appearing in the white areas of the Editor when in Source view. If you 
      need to make changes to the code within a Guarded Block, clicking the Design 
      button returns the IDE's Editor to the GUI Builder where you can make the necessary 
      adjustments to the form. When you save your changes, the IDE updates the file's 
      sources.</p> 
      <p><b>Note:</b> For advanced developers, the Palette Manager is available that 
         enables you to add custom components from JARs, libraries, or other projects 
      to the Palette. To add custom components through the Palette Manager, choose Tools &gt; Palette &gt; Swing/AWT Components. </p>

      <a name="key_concepts"></a> 
      <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
      <p>The IDE's GUI Builder solves the core problem of Java GUI creation by streamlining 
         the workflow of creating graphical interfaces, freeing developers from the complexities 
         of Swing layout managers. It does this by extending the current NetBeans IDE 
         GUI Builder to support a straightforward &quot;Free Design&quot; paradigm with simple 
         layout rules that are easy to understand and use. As you lay out your form, 
         the GUI Builder provides visual guidelines suggesting optimal spacing and alignment 
         of components. In the background, the GUI Builder translates your design decisions 
         into a functional UI that is implemented using the new GroupLayout layout manager 
         and other Swing constructs. Because it uses a dynamic layout model, GUI's built 
         with the GUI Builder behave as you would expect at runtime, adjusting to accommodate 
         any changes you make without altering the defined relationships between components. 
         Whenever you resize the form, switch locales, or specify a different look and 
         feel, your GUI automatically adjusts to respect the target look and feel's insets 
      and offsets.</p>
      <blockquote> 
	  <a name="design"></a>
         <h3 class="tutorial">Free Design</h3>
         <p>In the IDE's GUI Builder, you can build your forms by simply putting components 
            where you want them as though you were using absolute positioning. The GUI 
            Builder figures out which layout attributes are required and then generates 
            the code for you automatically. You need not concern yourself with insets, 
         anchors, fills, and so forth. </p>
          <a name="snapping"></a>
		 <h3 class="tutorial">Automatic Component Positioning (Snapping)</h3>
         
         <p>As you add components to a form, the GUI Builder provides visual feedback 
            that assists in positioning components based on your operating system's look 
            and feel. The GUI Builder provides helpful inline hints and other visual feedback 
            regarding where components should be placed on your form, automatically snapping 
            components into position along guidelines. It makes these suggestions based 
            on the positions of the components that have already been placed in the form, 
            while allowing the padding to remain flexible such that different target look 
         and feels render properly at runtime.</p>
		 <a name="feedback"></a>
         <h3 class="tutorial">Visual Feedback </h3>
         <p>The GUI Builder also provides visual feedback regarding component anchoring 
            and chaining relationships. These indicators enable you to quickly identify 
            the various positioning relationships and component pinning behavior that 
            affect the way your GUI will both appear and behave at runtime. This speeds 
            the GUI design process, enabling you to quickly create professional-looking 
         visual interfaces that work.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="align-center"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
      <a name="first_things"></a> 
      <h2>First Things First</h2>
      <p>Now that you have familiarized yourself with the GUI builder's interface, it's 
         time to begin developing the UI of our ContactEditor application. In this section 
         we'll take a look at using the IDE's Palette to add the various GUI components 
      that we need to our form. </p>
      <p>Thanks to the IDE's Free Design paradigm, you no longer have to struggle 
         with layout managers to control the size and position of the components within 
         your containers. All you need to do is drag and drop the 
         components you need to your GUI form as shown in the illustrations that follow.      </p>
   <blockquote> 
	  <p class="notes"><b>Note:</b> Refer to the <a name="add" href="http://bits.netbeans.org/media/quickstart-gui-add.swf">Adding individual and multiple components (.swf)</a> screencast for an interactive demo on the section below.</p>
          <a name="adding_components"></a> 
		 <h3 class="tutorial">Adding Components: The Basics </h3>
         <p>Though the IDE's GUI Builder simplifies the process of creating Java GUIs, 
            it is often helpful to sketch out the way you want your interface to look 
            before beginning to lay it out. Many interface designers consider this a &quot;best 
            practice&quot; technique, however, for the purposes of this tutorial you can simply 
            peek at how our completed form should look by jumping ahead to the <a href="#previewing_form">Previewing 
         your GUI </a>section. </p>
         <p>Since we've already added a JFrame as our form's top-level container, the 
            next step is to add a couple of JPanels which will enable us to cluster the 
            components of our UI using titled borders. Refer to the following illustrations 
         and notice the IDE's &quot;drag and drop&quot; behavior when accomplishing this. </p>
         <table width="91%">
            <tr> 
               <td>
                  <p>To add a JPanel: </p>
                  <ol>
                     <li>In the Palette window, select the Panel component from 
                     the Swing Containers category by clicking and releasing the mouse button.</li>
                     <li>Move the cursor to the upper left corner of the form in the GUI 
                        Builder. When the component is located near the container's top and 
                        left edges, horizontal and vertical alignment guidelines appear indicating 
                        the preferred margins. Click in the form to place the JPanel in this 
                     location. 
                     <p>The <tt>JPanel</tt> component appears in the <tt>ContactEditorUI</tt> 
                        form with orange highlighting signifying that it is selected. After releasing the mouse button, small 
                        indicators appear to show the component's anchoring relationships 
                     and a corresponding JPanel node is displayed in the Navigator window, as shown in the following illustration.</p></li>
                  </ol>
               </td>
            </tr>
         </table>
         
		  <p class="align-center">
		<a href="../../../images_www/articles/80/java/quickstart-gui/02_add_panels_1.png" rel="lytebox"
                       title="JPanel selected">

                     alt="JPanel selected" border=1></a></p>
         <p>Next, we need to resize the JPanel to make room for the components we'll 
            place within it a little later, but let's take a minute to point out another 
            of the GUI Builder's visualization features first. In order to do this we 
            need to deselect the JPanel we just added. Because we haven't added a title 
            border yet, the panel disappears. Notice, however, that when you pass the 
            cursor over the JPanel, its edges change to light gray so that its position 
            can be clearly seen. You need only to click anywhere within the component 
         to reselect it and cause the resize handles and anchoring indicators to reappear.</p>
         <table width="91%">
            <tr> 
               <td>
                  <p>To resize the JPanel:</p>
                  <ol>

         <p>Now we need to start adding the components that will present the actual contact 
            information in our contact list. In this task we'll add four JTextFields that 
            will display the contact information and the JLabels that will describe them. 
            While accomplishing this, notice the horizontal and vertical guidelines that 
            the GUI Builder displays, suggesting the preferred component spacing as defined 
            by your operating system's look and feel. This ensures that your GUI is automatically 
         rendered respecting the target operating system's look and feel at runtime.</p>

                        in the top left corner of the JPanel with a small margin at the top 
                     and left edges, click to place the label.

         <p>Often it is necessary to add a component between components that are already 
            placed in a form. Whenever you add a component between two existing components, 
            the GUI Builder automatically shifts them to make room for the new component. 
            To demonstrate this, we'll insert a JTextField between the JLabels we added 
         previously, as shown in the following two illustrations. </p>
         <table width="91%">
            <tr>

                        is aligned to their baselines. If you encounter difficulty positioning 
                        the new text field, you can snap it to the left guideline of the <tt>Nickname</tt> 
                     JLabel as shown in the first image below.</li>

      <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
      <p>Alignment is one of the most fundamental aspects of creating professional-looking 
         GUIs. In the previous section we got a glimpse of the IDE's alignment features 
         while adding the JLabel and JTextField components to our ContactEditorUI form. 
         Next, we'll take a more in depth look at the GUI Builder's alignment features 
      as we work with the various other components we need for our application.</p>

         <p>Every time you add a component to a form, the GUI Builder effectively aligns 
            them, as evidenced by the alignment guidelines that appear. It is sometimes 
            necessary, however, to specify different relationships between groups of components 
            as well. Earlier we added four JLabels that we need for our ContactEditor 
            GUI, but we didn't align them. Now we'll align the two columns of JLabels 
         so that their right edges line up. </p>

            sure that the two JTextFields we inserted between the JLabels are set to resize 
            correctly. Unlike the two JTextFields that we stretched to the right edge 
            of our form, inserted components' resizeability behavior isn't automatically

         <p>Now we need to add another JLabel describing the JComboBox that will enable

         <p>Whenever you add or move components that include text (JLabels, JTextFields, 
            and so forth), the IDE suggests alignments which are based on the baselines 
            of the text in the components. When we inserted the JTextField earlier, for 
         example, its baseline was automatically aligned to the adjacent JLabels. </p>
         <p>Now we'll add the combo box that will enable users to select the format of 
            the information that our ContactEditor application will display. As we add 
            the JComboBox, we'll align its baseline to that of the JLabel's text. Notice 
            once again the baseline alignment guidelines that appear to assist us with 
         the positioning. </p>

                     <li>Move the cursor immediately to the right of the JLabel we just added. 
                        When the horizontal guideline appears indicating that the JComboBox's 
                        baseline is aligned with the baseline of the text in the JLabel and 
                        the spacing between the two components is suggested with a vertical 
                     guideline, click to position the combo box.
                     <p> The component snaps into a position aligned with the baseline of

      <h2>Reviewing What We've Learned</h2>
      <p>We've got off to a good start building our ContactEditor GUI, but let's 
         take a minute to recap what we've learned while we add a few more of the components 
      our interface requires. </p>
      <p>Until now we've concentrated on adding components to our ContactEditor GUI 
         using the IDE's alignment guidelines to help us with positioning. It is important 
         to understand, however, that another integral part of component placement is 
         anchoring. Though we haven't discussed it yet, you've already taken advantage 
         of this feature without realizing it. As mentioned previously, whenever you 
         add a component to a form, the IDE suggests the target look and feel's preferred 
         positioning with guidelines. Once placed, new components are also anchored to 
         the nearest container edge or component to ensure that component relationships 
         are maintained at runtime. In this section, we'll concentrate on accomplishing 
         the tasks in a more streamlined fashion while pointing out the work the GUI 
      builder is doing behind the scenes. </p>

         <p>The GUI Builder enables you to lay out your forms quickly and easily by streamlining

            Builder automatically snaps them into the preferred positions and sets the 
            necessary chaining relationships so you can concentrate on designing your 
         forms rather than struggling with complicated implementation details. </p>

         <p>Since JLists are used to display long lists of data, they typically require 
            the addition of a JScrollPane. Whenever you add a component which requires 
            a JScrollPane, the GUI Builder automatically adds it for you. Because JScrollPanes 
            are non-visual components, you have to use the Inspector window in order to 
         view or edit any JScrollPanes that the GUI Builder created.</p>

         <p>It is often beneficial to set several related components, such as buttons 
            in modal dialogues, to be the same size for visual consistency. To demonstrate 
            this we'll add four JButtons to our ContactEditor form that will allow us 
            to add, edit, and remove individual entries from our contact list, as shown 
            in the following illustrations. Afterwards, we'll set the four buttons to 
            be the same size so they can be easily recognized as offering related functionality.

                        the JTextField, shift-click to place the first button along the JFrame's 
                        right edge. The JTextField's width shrinks to accommodate the JButton 
                     when you release the mouse button.

         <h3 class="tutorial">Indentation</h3>
         <p>Often it is necessary to cluster multiple components under another component 
            such that it is clear they belong to a group of related functions. One typical 
            case, for example, is placing several related checkboxes below a common label. 
            The GUI Builder enables you to accomplish indenting easily by providing special 
            guidelines suggesting the preferred offset for your operating system's look 
         and feel.</p>
         <p>In this section we'll add a few JRadioButtons below a JLabel that will allow 
            users to customize the way the application displays data. Refer to the following 
            illustrations while accomplishing this or click the View Demo link following 
         the procedure to view an interactive demonstration. </p>

                  <ol>
                     <li> Add a JLabel named <tt>Mail Format</tt> to the form below the JList. 
                     Make certain the label is left aligned with the JList above.</li>
                     <li>In the Palette window, select the Radio Button component from the 
                     Swing category. </li>
                     <li>Move the cursor below the JLabel that we just added. When the guidelines 
                        appear indicating that the JRadioButton's left edge is aligned with 
                        that of the JLabel, move the JRadioButton slightly to the right until 
                        secondary indentation guidelines appear. Shift-click to place the 
                     first radio button.

                        the suggested component spacing. Make certain to release the Shift 
                     key prior to positioning the last JRadioButton. </li>
                     <li>Set the display text for each JRadioButton. 
                        (You can edit a button's text by right-clicking the button and choosing 
                        Edit Text. Or you can click the button, pause, and then click again.)

      <h2>Making the Final Adjustments </h2>
      <p>We've managed to rough out our ContactEditor application's GUI, but there are 
         still a few things remaining to do. In this section, we'll take a look at a 
      couple of other typical layout tasks that the GUI Builder streamlines. </p>
      <blockquote> 
         <h3 class="tutorial">Finishing Up</h3>
         <p>Now we need to add the buttons that will enable users to confirm the information 
            they enter for an individual contact and add it to the contact list or cancel, 
            leaving the database unchanged. In this step, we'll add the two required buttons 
            and then edit them so that they appear the same size in our form even though 
         their display text are different lengths.</p>

                     <li>If the lower JPanel is extended to the bottom edge of the JFrame 
                        form, drag the bottom edge of the JFrame down. This gives you space 
                        between the edge of the JFrame and the edge of the JPanel for your 
                     OK and Cancel buttons.</li>
                     <li>In the Palette window, select the Button component from

                     with the lower right corner of the JFrame, click to place the button.

            form can be a helpful technique in avoiding problems with component alignments 
            and anchoring relationships, most developers typically remove this text in 
            the process of laying out their forms. As you go through the form, select 
            and delete the placeholder text for each of the JTextFields. We'll leave the 
         placeholder items in both the JComboBox and JList for a later tutorial.</p>

      <h2>Deploying GUI Applications</h2>
      <p>In order for the interfaces you create with the GUI Builder to work outside 
         of the IDE, the application must be compiled against classes for the GroupLayout 
         layout manager and also have those classes available at runtime. These classes 
         are included in Java SE 6, but not in Java SE 5. If you develop the application 
         to run on Java SE 5, your application needs to use the Swing Layout Extensions library.      </p>
      <p>If you are running the IDE on JDK 5, the IDE automatically generates your application code 
         to use the Swing Layout Extensions library. When you deploy the application, you need to 
         include the Swing Layout Extensions library with the application. When you build the application 
         (Build &gt; Build Main Project), the IDE 
         automatically provides a copy of the library's JAR file in the application's <tt>dist/lib</tt> 
         folder.  The IDE also adds each of the JAR files that are in the <tt>dist</tt> folder
         to the <tt>Class-Path</tt> element in the application JAR file's <tt>manifest.mf</tt> 
      file. </p>
      <p>If you are running the IDE on JDK 6, the IDE generates your application code 
         to use the GroupLayout classes that are in Java SE 6. This means that you can deploy the application 
         to run on systems with Java SE 6 installed and you do not need to package 
      your application with the Swing Layout Extensions library.</p>

         <b>Note:</b> If you create your application using JDK 6 but you need the application 
         to also run on Java SE 5, you can have the IDE generate its code to use the Swing Layout Extensions library 
         instead of the classes in Java SE 6. Open the ContactEditorUI class in the GUI Editor. 
         In the Navigator, right-click the Form ContactEditorUI node and choose Properties in the popup menu. 
         In the Properties dialog box, change the value of the Layout Generation Style property to 
         Swing Layout Extensions Library.      </div>

         <h3 class="tutorial">Distributing and Running Standalone GUI Applications</h3>
         
         
         <p>To prepare your GUI application for distribution outside of the IDE:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Zip the project's <tt>dist</tt> folder into 
               a ZIP archive. (The <tt>dist</tt> folder might also contain a <tt>lib</tt> folder, 
            which you would also need to include.)</li>
         </ul>
		 <p>To run your application, right-click the project name and select Run in the context menu. In the Run Project dialog select the main class name (<tt>my.contacteditor.ContactEditorUI</tt> if speaking about the project you have just created) and click OK. Your application is up and running.</p>
         <p>To run a standalone GUI application from the command line:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Navigate to the project's <tt>dist</tt> folder.</li>
            <li>Type the following: 
               <blockquote> <tt>java -jar &lt;jar_name&gt;.jar</tt> </blockquote>
            </li>
         </ol>
         
      </blockquote>
      <p><b>Note:</b> If you encounter 
      the following error:</p>
      <blockquote><tt>Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/jdesktop/layout/GroupLayout$Group</tt></blockquote>
      <p>Ensure that the <tt>manifest.mf</tt> file references the currently installed version 
      of the Swing Layout Extensions Library. </p>
