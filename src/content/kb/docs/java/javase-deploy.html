        <h1>Packaging and Distributing Java Desktop Applications</h1>
        
        <p>One question that a lot of beginning programmers have is: &quot;Now that I've created my 
            application in the IDE, how do I get it to work from the command line outside of the IDE.&quot; 
            Similarly, someone might ask, &quot;How do I distribute this application to other users 
            without having to give them the whole IDE as well?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>The answers to these questions are relatively simple, but not necessarily obvious. 
            This document addresses those questions by taking you through the basics of using the IDE to 
            prepare your applications for distribution and deployment. In addition, 
            this document provides information that you might need to configure your system (or which 
            you might need to pass on to the users of your application).
            We will show a few different approaches for deploying an application, so that 
            users can access the application by:</p>
    <ul>
                <li>Double-clicking the application's Java Archive (JAR) file.</li>
                <li>Calling the application from the command line.</li>
                <li>Calling the application from a script file.</li>
                <li>Using Java Web Start.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="createjar" id="createjar"></a>Creating Executable JAR File</h2> 
        <p>This part of the tutorial shows how you can create a distributable application in the IDE 
        and then run that application from outside of the IDE. We will package 
        the application in the form of an executable <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/run.html" target="_blank">JAR</a> file. </p>
        <p>A JAR file is an archive file 
          that can contain multiple files and folders. JAR files are similar to zip files,  
          but JAR files can have additional attributes 
          that are useful for distributing Java applications. These attributes include digitally signing JAR files, additional compression, multiplatform compatibility, etc. </p>
        <p>In this exercise, you create an IDE project and then place two pre-written 
        Java source files into that project. 
        Then you will compile the classes and build an executable JAR file. Afterwards, you will 
        learn how to run the JAR file from outside of the IDE.</p>
        <p>The classes used in this tutorial implement
            features of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grep/">GNU grep</a> utility, which can 
            be used for searching text or regular expression patterns inside text files. 
            The project contains both command-line 
            and GUI versions of the application, so that you can see different ways of running 
            the application.        </p>
        
        
  
            <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="setup"></a>Creating a Project with Existing Sources </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>Download the <a href="https://netbeans.org/projects/samples/downloads/download/Samples%252FJava%252FDeploymentTutorial.zip" target="_blank">DeploymentTutorial.zip</a> file and extract its contents on your system.  <br>
                    This zip archive contains source files for the application plus a few other 
                    files that will be used in the tutorial.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>In NetBeans IDE, choose File &gt; New Project.</p>
                </li>
                <li>In the Choose Category page, select 
                Java Project With Existing Sources in the Java category and click Next.</li>
                <li>On the Name and Location page of the wizard, type <tt>AnotherGrep</tt> as the project name and specify the project's location. <br>
                  Click Next.
                    <p class="tips">The project folder does <i>not</i> have to be in the same location as
                the source files that you are importing into the project.</p>
                </li>
                <li>On the Existing Sources page of the wizard,  specify the 
                sources that will be in the project. 
                  <br>
                  Click the Add Folder button that is to the right of the 
                Source Package Folders field. Navigate to the <tt>DeploymentTutorial</tt> 
                folder that you have just unzipped on your system, expand the folder, 
                select the <tt>src</tt> folder, and click Open. 
                The <tt>src</tt> folder is added to your 
                Source Package Folders field.</li>
                <li>Click Finish.<br>
                  <p class="notes"><b>Note:</b> If, for example, you want to exclude some source files from importing into the project, click Next to open the last Includes &amp; Excludes window. In our case, we want to use all the source files in the <tt>src</tt> folder, so we click Finish to finish working in the New Project wizard.        </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        
            <p>The project opens in the IDE and becomes visible in the Projects window. 
            You can explore the contents of the project by expanding the project's Source Packages node, where you 
            should see classes called <tt>Grep</tt> and <tt>xGrep</tt>. <tt>Grep.java</tt> is a console 
            version of the application. <tt>xGrep.java</tt> is a GUI version of the 
            application and uses methods defined in <tt>Grep.java</tt>.</p>

            <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="configure"></a>Configuring the Project</h3>
        
            <p>There are a few configuration steps you need to do, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose the Java platform that will be used to compile the sources. </li>
                <li>Set the project's main class. By doing this, you ensure that the 
                JAR file that you create when you build the project is executable.</li>
            </ul>
      
                <h4>Verifying the Java Platform</h4>
                <p>Our project needs to be compiled and run on Java 7 or Java 8 platform. Therefore, you need to make sure that Java 7 or Java 8 is respectively used as the platform for this project.  </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Right-click the project's node and choose Properties.</li>
                  <li>On the Libraries tab, ensure that the Java Platform is JDK 1.7 (or JDK 1.8).</li>
                  <li>On the Sources tab, choose JDK 7 (or JDK 8) in the Source/Binary format.</li>
                  <li>Click OK to close the Properties window. </li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Setting the Main Class</h4>
                <p>In order for a user to easily run your JAR file (by double-clicking 
                    the JAR file or by typing <tt>java -jar AnotherGrep.jar</tt>
                    at the command line), a main class has to be specified inside the JAR's
                    <i>manifest</i> file. (The manifest is a standard part of the JAR file 
                    that contains information about the JAR file that is useful for 
                    the <tt>java</tt> launcher when you want to run the application.)
                The main class serves as an entry point from which the <tt>java</tt> launcher runs your application. </p>
                <p>When you build a project, the IDE builds the JAR file and includes a 
                manifest. When you set the project's main class, you ensure that the 
                main class is be designated in the manifest.</p>
                <p>To set the project's main class:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Right-click the project's node and choose Properties.</li>
                    <li>Select the Run category and enter <tt>anothergrep.xGrep</tt> 
                    in the Main Class field.</li>
                    <li>Click OK to close the Project Properties dialog box.</li>
                </ol>
        <p>When you build the project later in this tutorial, the manifest will be 
        generated and include the following entry:</p>
    <pre class="examplecode">Main-Class: anothergrep.xGrep</pre>
    <h3><a name="build"></a>Building the Project and Creating the JAR File </h3>
            <p>Now that you have your sources ready and your project configured, it is time 
            to build your project.</p> 
            <p>To build the project:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose Run &gt; Build Project (AnotherGrep).<br>
              Alternatively, right-click the project's node in the Projects window and choose Build. </li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>When you build your project:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><tt>build</tt> and <tt>dist</tt> folders are added to your 
                project folder (hereafter referred to as the <i>PROJECT_HOME</i> 
                folder).</li>
                <li>All of the sources are compiled into <tt>.class</tt> files, which are 
                placed into the <tt><i>PROJECT_HOME</i>/build</tt> folder.</li>
                <li>A JAR file containing your project is created inside the 
                <tt><i>PROJECT_HOME</i>/dist</tt> folder.</li>
                <li>If you have specified any libraries for the project (in addition to the JDK), 
                    a <tt>lib</tt> folder is created in the <tt>dist</tt> folder. 
                    The libraries are copied into <tt>dist/lib</tt>.
                </li>
                <li>The manifest file in the JAR is updated to include entries that designate   
                main class and any libraries that are on the project's classpath.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="notes"><b>Note:</b> You can view the contents of the manifest in the IDE's Files window.  
            After you have built your project, switch to the Files window and navigate to 
            <tt>dist/AnotherGrep.jar</tt>. Expand the node for the JAR file, expand the 
            <tt>META-INF</tt> folder, and double-click <tt>MANIFEST.MF</tt> 
            to display the manifest in the Source Editor.</p>
            <pre class="examplecode">Main-Class: anothergrep.xGrep</pre>
            
            (To find more about manifest files, you
            can read 
            <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/deployment/jar/manifestindex.html">this chapter</a>
          from the Java Tutorial.) 
          <h2 class="tutorial"><a name="run"></a>Running and Distributing the JAR File </h2>
          <h3 class="tutorial">Running the Application Inside of the IDE</h3>
          <p>When developing applications in the IDE, typically you will need 
            to test and refine them before distributing. You can easily test 
            an application that you are working on by running the application from
            the IDE.</p>
            <p>To run the <tt>AnotherGrep</tt> project in the IDE, right-click the 
            project's node in the Projects window and choose Run.</p>
            <p>The xGrep window should open. You can click the Browse button to 
            choose a file in which to search for a text pattern. In the Search Pattern 
            field, type text or a regular expression pattern that you would like 
            to match, and click Search. 
            The results of each match will appear in the xGrep window's Output area.</p> 
            <p>Information 
            on regular expressions that you can use in this application are available 
            <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/html_node/Regular-Expressions.html#Regular-Expressions">here</a> and in 
            many other places.</p>



            <h3 class="tutorial">Running the Application Outside of the IDE</h3>
            <p>Once you have finished developing the application and before you 
            distribute it, you will probably want to 
            make sure that the application also works outside of the IDE.</p>
            <p>You can run the application outside of the IDE by following these steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In your system's file manager (for example, in the My Computer window on 
                Windows XP systems), navigate to <tt><i>PROJECT_HOME</i>/dist</tt> and 
                double-click the <tt>AnotherGrep.jar</tt> file. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>You will know that the application has started successfully when the xGrep window opens.</p>
            <p>If the xGrep window does not open, your system probably does not have a 
            file association between JAR files and the Java Runtime Environment. 
            See <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting JAR File Associations</a> below.</p>

            <h3 class="tutorial">Distributing the Application to Other Users</h3>       
            <p>Now that you have verified that the application works outside of the IDE, 
            you are ready to distribute it.</p>
                       
            <ul>
              <li>Send the application's JAR file to the people who will use the application. The users of your application should be able to run it by 
                double-clicking the JAR file. If this does not work for them, 
                show them the information in the 
                <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting JAR File Associations</a> section below.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="notes"><strong>Note:</strong> If your application depends on additional libraries other than those included in JDK, you need to also include them in your distribution (not the case in our example). The relative paths to these libraries are added in the <tt>classpath</tt> entry of the JAR's manifest file when you are developing your application in the IDE. If these additional libraries will not be found at the specified classpath (i.e., relative path) at launch, the application will not start. <br>
    Create a zip archive that contains the application JAR file and the library and provide this zip file to users. Instruct the users to unpack the zip file making sure that the JAR file and libraries JAR files are in the same folder. Run the application JAR file.

        <h2><a name="startapp" ></a>Starting Your Java Application</h2>
            
        <p>The goal of this exercise is to show you some ways that you can 
        start your application from the command line.</p>     
       
        <p>This exercise shows you how you can start a Java application in the 
        following two ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Running the <tt>java</tt> command from the command line.</li>
            <li>Using a script to a call a class in the JAR file.</li>
        </ul>
  
            <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="commandline" id="commandline"></a>Launching Applications From the Command Line</h3>
            <p>You can launch an application from the command line by using the <tt>java</tt> 
            command. If you want to run an executable JAR file, use the <tt>-jar</tt> 
            option of the command.</p>
            <p>For example, to run the AnotherGrep application, you would take the 
            following steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Open a terminal window. On Microsoft Windows systems, you do this by 
                choosing Start &gt; Run, typing <tt>cmd</tt> in the Open field, and 
                clicking OK.</li>
                <li>Change directories to the <tt><i>PROJECT_HOME</i>/dist</tt> folder 
                (using the <tt>cd</tt> command).</li>
                <li>Type the following line to run the application's main class:
                <pre class="examplecode">java -jar AnotherGrep.jar</pre></li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you follow these steps and the application does not run, you 
            probably need to do one of the following things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Include the full path to the <tt>java</tt> binary in the 
                third step of the procedure. For example, you would type 
                something like the following, depending on where your JDK or JRE is 
                located:
                  <pre class="examplecode">C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_51\bin\java -jar AnotherGrep.jar</pre>
                </li>
                <li>Add the Java binaries to your PATH environment variable, so 
                that you never have to specify the path to the <tt>java</tt> binary from the command line. 
                See <a href="#path">Setting the PATH Environment Variable</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="script"></a>Launching Applications From a Script</h3>
            <p>If the application that you want to distribute is a console 
            application, you might find that it is convenient to start the application from a 
            a script, particularly if the application takes long and complex arguments to run. 
            In this section, you will use a console version of the Grep program, 
            where you need to pass the arguments (search pattern and file list)
            to the JAR file, which will be invoked in our script. To reduce typing 
            at the command line, you will use a 
            simple script suitable to run the test application.</p>
            <p>First you need to change the main class in the application to be the 
            console version of the class and rebuild the JAR file:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In the IDE's Projects window, right-click the project's node (<tt>AnotherGrep</tt>) 
                and choose Properties.</li>
                <li>Select the Run node and change the Main Class property to
                <tt>anothergrep.Grep</tt> (from <tt>anothergrep.xGrep</tt>). 
                Click OK to close the Project Properties window.</li>
                <li>Right-click the project's node again and choose Clean and Build 
                Project.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>After completing these steps, the JAR file is rebuilt, and the 
            <tt>Main-Class</tt> attribute of the JAR file's manifest is changed to 
            point to <tt>anothergrep.Grep</tt>.</p>
         
    <h4><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">BASH</a> script -- for UNIX and Linux machines</h4>
                <p>
                    Inside the folder on your system where you extracted the contents of the <a href="https://netbeans.org/projects/samples/downloads/download/Samples%252FJava%252FDeploymentTutorial.zip" target="_blank">DeploymentTutorial.zip</a> file, there is a <tt>grep.sh</tt> bash script. Have a look at it:</p>
              <pre class="examplecode">#!/bin/bash
                    java -jar dist/AnotherGrep.jar $@</pre>
                
                <p>
                    The first line states which shell should be used to interpret this. The second one executes your JAR file, created
                    by the IDE inside <tt><i>PROJECT_HOME</i>/dist</tt> folder. <tt>$@</tt> just copies all given arguments,
                    enclosing each inside quotes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This script presumes that the Java binaries are part of your PATH environment variable. 
                    If the script does not work for you, see <a href="#path">Setting the PATH Environment Variable</a>.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    More about bash scripting can be found <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html">here</a>.
                </p>
            
                <h4>.bat script for Windows machines</h4>
                <p>
                    On Microsoft Windows systems, you can only pass nine arguments 
                    at once to a batch file. If there were more than 
                    nine arguments, you would need to execute
                    the JAR file multiple times.
                </p>
                <p>A script handling this might look like the following:</p>
              <pre class="examplecode">
                @echo off
                set jarpath=&quot;dist/AnotherGrep.jar&quot;
                set pattern=&quot;%1&quot;
                shift
                :loop
                  if &quot;%1&quot; == &quot;&quot; goto :allprocessed
                  set files=%1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
                  java -jar %jarpath% %pattern% %files%
                  for %%i in (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8) do shift
                goto :loop

                :allprocessed
                    </pre>
                    <p>This script is included as <tt>grep.bat</tt> inside the folder on your system where you extracted the contents of the <a href="https://netbeans.org/projects/samples/downloads/download/Samples%252FJava%252FDeploymentTutorial.zip" target="_blank">DeploymentTutorial.zip</a> file so you can try it out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The nine arguments are represented inside the batch file by <tt>%&lt;ARG_NUMBER&gt;</tt>, where <tt>&lt;ARG_NUMBER&gt;</tt> has to be inside
                    <tt>&lt;0-9&gt;</tt>. <tt>%0</tt> is reserved for the script name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can see that only nine arguments are passed to the program at a time (in one loop). The <tt>for</tt> statement
                    just shifts the arguments by nine, to prepare it for next loop. Once an empty file argument is detected by the
                    <tt>if</tt> statement (there are no further files to process), the loop is ended.
                </p>
                <p>

            <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="jarfiles"></a>Specifying JAR File Associations </h3>
            <p>On most systems, you can execute an executable JAR file by simply 
              double-clicking the JAR file. If nothing happens when you double-click the 
              JAR file, it might be because of either of the following two reasons:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The JAR file type is probably not associated with a Java Runtime Environment 
                (JRE) on that system.
                <p>If the JAR file type is associated with a JRE, 
                  the icon that represents that file should include a Java logo.</p>
              </li>
              <li>The JAR file type is associated with the JRE, but the <tt>-jar</tt> option is not included in the command that is passed to the JRE when you 
                double-click the icon.</li>
    </ul>
            <p class="notes"><b>Note:</b> Sometimes JAR file associations are switched by
              software that you install, such as software to handle zip files.</p>
            <p>The way how you associate the JAR file type with the <tt>java</tt> launcher depends on your operating system. </p>
            <p class="notes"><b>Note:</b> Make sure that there is a version of the 
                JRE installed on your system. You should use version 1.4.2 or 
                later. You cannot launch a Java application if no Java is installed. (If you have the JDK installed, you also get the JRE. 
                However, if you are distributing the program to a non-programmer, 
                that person does not necessarily have either the JRE or the JDK.)</p>
                <ul>
				<li>On Windows XP, you can check for installed versions of Java by choosing 
                  Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Add or Remove Software (you should see, for example, Java(TM) 7 Update 51). </li>
				<li>On Windows Vista or 7, you can check for installed versions of Java by choosing Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Programs and Components (you should see, for example, Java(TM) 7 Update 51). </li>
				</ul>
                <p>If there is no Java on the system, you can get the JRE one from 
                  the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" target="_blank">Java SE download site</a>.</p>
                <p>If you have Java installed on your system, but the file association 
                  is not working, continue with the steps for adding the JAR file association on Microsoft Windows:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Choose Start &gt; Control Panel.</li>
			  <li>(Applicable to Windows Vista only.) Click Control Panel Home &gt; Programs.</li>
              <li>For Windows XP, double-click Folder Options and select the File Types tab.<br>
                 For Windows Vista or 7, click Default Programs and select Associate a file type or protocol with a program.</li>
              <li>In the Registered File Types list, select JAR File.</li>
              <li>(On Windows XP, in the Details section of the dialog box), click Change Program.</li>
              <li>In the Open With dialog box, select Java Platform SE Binary.</li>
              <li>Click OK to exit the Open With dialog box.</li>
              <li>Click Close to exit the Folder Options dialog box (on Windows XP) or the Associate a file type or protocol with a specific program dialog box (on Windows 7).</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="notes"><b>Note:</b> If JAR files are associated with the Java Platform SE Binary on your 
              system but double-clicking still does not execute the file JAR file, 
              you might need to specify the <tt>-jar</tt> option in the file association.</p>
            <p>To specify the <tt>-jar</tt> option in the file association on Microsoft Windows XP:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Choose Start &gt; Control Panel.</li>
			  <li>For Windows XP, double-click Folder Options and select the File Types tab.</li>
              <li>In the Registered File Types list, select JAR File.</li>
              <li>In the Details section of the dialog box, click Advanced.</li>
              <li>In the Edit File Type dialog box, click Edit.</li>
              <li>In the Application Used to Perform Action text field, add the 
                following at the end of the path to the JRE:
                <pre class="examplecode"> -jar &quot;%1&quot; %*</pre>
                Afterwards, the field should contain text similar to the following:
                <pre class="examplecode">&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.7.0_51\bin\javaw.exe&quot; -jar &quot;%1&quot; %*</pre>

              <li>Click OK to exit the Edit File Type dialog box.</li>
              <li>Click Close to exit the Folder Options dialog box.</li>
            </ol>
			<p class="notes"><b>Note:</b> Starting with Windows Vista advanced file associations can be set via RegEdit. See the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee914604.aspx">What Happened to the File Types Dialog?</a> article for details.</p>
            <p>For UNIX and Linux systems, the procedure for changing file associations 
              depends on which desktop environment (such as GNOME or KDE) that 
              you are using. Look in your desktop environment's preference settings 
              or consult the documentation for the desktop environment.</p>
            <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="path"></a>Setting the PATH Environment Variable </h3>
            If you can not run a Java class or JAR file on your system without 
            pointing to the location of the JDK or JRE on your system, you 
            might need to modify the value of your system's <tt>PATH</tt> variable.
            <p>If you are running on a Microsoft Windows system, the procedure for 
            setting the PATH variable depends the version of Windows you are using.</p>
            <p>The following are the steps for setting the <tt>PATH</tt> variable 
            on a Windows XP system:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Choose Start &gt; Control Panel and double-click System.</li>
                <li>In the System Properties dialog box, click the Advanced tab.</li>
                <li>Click the Environment Variables tab.</li>
                <li>In the list of user variables, select <tt>PATH</tt> 
            and click Edit.</li>
            <li>Add the location of the JRE to the end of the list of paths. The 
            locations in this list are separated by semicolons (;).
            <br>
            For example, if your JRE is located at <code>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_51</code> you would add the following to the end of the PATH variable:
                <pre class="examplecode">C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_51\bin</pre>
            </li>
                <li>Click OK to exit the Environment Variables dialog box, and click OK 
                to exit the System Properties dialog box.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you are running on a UNIX or Linux system, the instructions for modifying your PATH 
            variable depends on the shell program you are using. Consult the 
            documentation of the shell that you are using for more information.</p>
