        <p>Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI), specified by <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299">JSR-299</a>,
            is an integral part of Java EE 6 and provides an architecture that allows Java
            EE components such as servlets, enterprise beans, and JavaBeans to exist within
            the lifecycle of an application with well-defined scopes. In addition, CDI
            services allow Java EE components such as EJB session beans and JavaServer
            Faces (JSF) managed beans to be injected and to interact in a loosely coupled
            way by firing and observing events.</p>

        <p>This tutorial is based on the blog post by Andy Gibson, entitled
            <a href="http://www.andygibson.net/blog/index.php/2010/01/11/getting-started-with-jsf-2-0-and-cdi-part-3/">Getting
            Started with CDI part 3 â€“ Events</a>. It demonstrates how to take advantage of
            the Java EE concept of <em>events</em>, in which you produce and subscribe to
            (i.e., <em>observe</em>) events occuring in your application in a way that enables
            you to maintain decoupled code between producers and observers. You use the
            <code>javax.enterprise.event.Event</code> class to create events, and CDI's
            <code>@Observes</code> annotation to subscribe to events.</p>

        <p>NetBeans IDE provides built-in support for Contexts and Dependency Injection,
            including the option of generating the <code>beans.xml</code> CDI configuration
            file upon project creation, editor and navigation support for annotations, as
            well as various wizards for creating commonly used CDI artifacts.</p>

        <br>
        <h2 id="event">Utilizing Events</h2>

        <p>In the previous tutorial, <a href="cdi-validate.html">Applying @Alternative
            Beans and Lifecycle Annotations</a>, we had an application that obtained a
            list of items, validated them and took a specific action when an invalid item
            was found. Let's say in the future we want to expand our system to handle all
            sorts of things happening when we find an invalid item. This could range from
            an email being sent, changes made to other data such as an order being canceled,
            or storing a list of rejections in a file or database table. To completely
            decouple the implementation we can use <em>events</em> in Java EE. Events are
            raised by the event <em>producer</em> and subscribed to by event <em>observers</em>.
            Like most of CDI, event production and subscription is type-safe and allows
            qualifiers to determine which events observers will be observing.</p>

        <p>Using the application we've been building from the previous tutorials in the
            series, we don't require many changes to implement this. We can just provide
            another implementation of <code>ItemErrorHandler</code> (created in
            <a href="cdi-validate.html">the previous tutorial</a>), which raises an event
            each time it handles an item. We'll name this class <code>EventItemHandler</code>,
            inject it into the <code>ItemProcessor</code>, and use a <code>Notify</code>
            qualifier to select it for injection.</p>

        <div class="indent">

                 title="Use CDI injection to loosely couple classes in your application">
        </div>

        <ol>
            <li>Begin by extracting the sample start project from the <code>cdiDemo3.zip</code>
                file (See the <a href="#requiredSoftware">table listing required resources</a>
                above.) Open the project in the IDE by choosing File &gt; Open Project (Ctrl-Shift-O;
                &#8984;-Shift-O on Mac), then selecting the project from its location on your
                computer.</li>

            <li>Create a class named <code>EventItemHandler</code>.

                Click the New File (
                <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/javaee/cdi-common/new-file-btn.png"
                alt="New File button"> ) button or press Ctrl-N (&#8984;-N on Mac) to open the
                File wizard.</li>

            <li>Select the Java category, then select Java Class. Click Next.</li>

            <li>Type in <strong>EventItemHandler</strong> as the class name, then enter <strong>exercise4</strong>
                as the package.</li>

            <li>Click Finish. The new class and package are generated, and the class opens in
                the editor.</li>

            <li>Implement <strong>EventItemHandler</strong> as follows.

                <pre class="examplecode">
public class EventItemHandler <strong>implements ItemErrorHandler</strong> {

    <strong>@Inject
    private Event&lt;Item&gt; itemEvent;

    @Override
    public void handleItem(Item item) {
        System.out.println("Firing Event");
        itemEvent.fire(item);
    }</strong>
}</pre>

                We inject an instance of an <code>Event</code> where the event payload will
                be an <code>Item</code>. The event payload is the state data passed from the
                event producer to the event observer which in this case passes the rejected
                Item. When the invalid item is handled, we fire the event and pass in the
                invalid item we received. This event based item handler is injected the
                same as any other item handler would be so we can swap it in and out whenever
                we need to and also can substitute it during testing.</li>

            <li>Fix all imports. Either right-click in the editor and choose Fix Imports,
                or press Ctrl-Shift-I (&#8984;-Shift-I on Mac). Be sure to select
                <code>javax.enterprise.event.Event</code> as the fully qualified name to
                the <code>Event</code> class.

                    definition of the class. The <code>fire()</code> method, used above, is

                     alt="Javadoc popup in editor" class="margin-around b-all"></li>

            <li>Create a qualifier named <code>Notify</code>. (Qualifiers were discussed
                in <a href="cdi-inject.html">Working with Injection and Qualifiers in CDI</a>.)</li>

            <li>Click the New File (
                <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/javaee/cdi-common/new-file-btn.png"
                alt="New File button"> ) button or press Ctrl-N (&#8984;-N on Mac) to open
                the File wizard.</li>

            <li>Select the Context and Dependency Injection category, then select Qualifier
                Type. Click Next.</li>

            <li>Enter <strong>Notify</strong> as the class name, then enter <strong>exercise4</strong>
                as the package.</li>

            <li>Click Finish. The new <code>Notify</code> qualifier opens in the editor.

<pre class="examplecode">
@Qualifier
@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Target({METHOD, FIELD, PARAMETER, TYPE})
public @interface Notify {
}</pre></li>

            <li>Add the <code>@Notify</code> annotation to <code>EventItemHandler</code>.

                <pre class="examplecode">
<strong>@Notify</strong>
public class EventItemHandler implements ItemErrorHandler {

    ...
}</pre>

                We created a <code>@Notify</code> qualifier annotation to identify this error
                handler for injection and can use it in our <code>ItemProcessor</code> by adding
                it to the injection point.</li>

            <li>Add the <code>@Notify</code> annotation to <code>EventItemHandler</code>'s
                injection point in <code>exercise2.ItemProcessor</code>.

                <pre class="examplecode">
@Named
@RequestScoped
public class ItemProcessor {

    @Inject @Demo
    private ItemDao itemDao;

    @Inject
    private ItemValidator itemValidator;

    @Inject <strong>@Notify</strong>
    private ItemErrorHandler itemErrorHandler;

    public void execute() {
        List&lt;Item&gt; items = itemDao.fetchItems();
        for (Item item : items) {
            if (!itemValidator.isValid(item)) {
                itemErrorHandler.handleItem(item);
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>
                (Use the editor's hint to add the import statement for <code>exercise4.Notify</code>.)</li>

            <li>Click the Run Project ( <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/javaee/cdi-common/run-project-btn.png"
                alt="Run Project button"> ) button to run the project.</li>

            <li>In the browser, click the '<code>Execute</code>' button, then return
                to the IDE and examine the server log in the Output window (Ctrl-4;
                &#8984;-4 on Mac). Because the application that you have been building
                currently uses the <code>DefaultItemDao</code> to set up four <code>Item</code>s,
                then applies the <code>RelaxedItemValidator</code> on the <code>Item</code>s,
                you expect to see the <code>itemErrorHandler</code> fire twice.

                <br>
                <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/javaee/cdi-events/output-window.png"
                     title="View the GlassFish server log displayed in Output window"
                     alt="Output window - GlassFish server log" class="margin-around b-all">

                <br>
                Currently though, we don't have anything observing the event. We can fix
                this by creating an <em>observer</em> method using the <code>@Observes</code>
                annotation. This is the only thing needed to observe an event. To demonstrate,
                we can modify the <code>FileErrorReporter</code> (created in the
                <a href="cdi-validate.html">previous tutorial</a>) to respond to fired events
                by adding an observer method that calls its <code>handleItem()</code> method.</li>

            <li>To make our <code>FileErrorReporter</code> respond to the event, add the
                following method to the class.

                <pre class="examplecode">
public class FileErrorReporter implements ItemErrorHandler {

    <strong>public void eventFired(@Observes Item item) {
        handleItem(item);
    }</strong>

    ...
}</pre>

                (Use the editor's hint to add an import statement for <code>javax.enterprise.event.Observes</code>.)</li>

            <li>Run the project (F6; fn-F6 on Mac) again, click the '<code>Execute</code>'
                button, then return to the IDE and examine the server log in the Output window.

                <br>
                <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/javaee/cdi-events/output-window2.png"
                     title="View the GlassFish server log displayed in Output window"
                     alt="Output window - GlassFish server log" class="margin-around b-all">

                <br>
                You see that the events are fired on the invalid objects as they were
                previously, but now the item information is being saved when each event
                is fired. You can also note that the lifecycle events are being observed,
                since a <code>FileErrorReporter</code> bean is created and closed for each
                fired event. (See <a href="cdi-validate.html">Applying @Alternative Beans
                and Lifecycle Annotations</a> for a discussion of lifecycle annotations,
                e.g., <code>@PostConstruct</code> and <code>@PreDestroy</code>.)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>As shown in the above steps, the <code>@Observes</code> annotation provides an
            easy way to observe an event.</p>

        <p class="tips">Events and observers can also be annotated with qualifiers to enable
            observers to only observe specific events for an item. See
            <a href="http://www.andygibson.net/blog/index.php/2010/01/11/getting-started-with-jsf-2-0-and-cdi-part-3/">Getting
            Started with CDI part 3 â€“ Events</a> for a demonstration.</p>


        <br>
        <h2 id="scopes">Handling Scopes</h2>

        <p>In the present state of the application, a <code>FileErrorReporter</code> bean
            is created each time the event is raised. In this case, we don't want to create
            a new bean each time since we don't want to open and close the file for each
            item. We still want to open the file at the start of the process, and then close
            it once the process it completed. Therefore, we need to consider the <em>scope</em>
            of the <code>FileErrorReporter</code> bean.</p>

        <p>Currently, the <code>FileErrorReporter</code> bean doesn't have a scope defined.
            When no scope is defined, CDI uses the default pseudo-dependent scope. What this
            means in practice is that the bean is created and destroyed over a very short
            space of time, typically over a method call. In our present scenario, the bean is
            created and destroyed for the duration of the event being fired. To fix this,
            we can lengthen the bean's scope by manually adding a scope annotation. We'll
            make this bean <code>@RequestScoped</code> so when the bean is created with the
            first event being fired, it will continue to exist for the duration of the
            request. This also means that for any injection points that this bean is qualified
            to be injected to, the same bean instance will be injected.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Add the <code>@RequestScope</code> annotation and corresponding import statement
                for <code>javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped</code> to the <code>FileErrorReporter</code>
                class.

                <pre class="examplecode">
<strong>import javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped;</strong>
...

<strong>@RequestScoped</strong>

                    code completion support. When choosing an item through code completion, any
                    associated import statements are automatically added to the class.</span>

                Note that the <code>FileErrorReporter</code> bean is only created when the
                first event is fired, and is closed after the final event has been fired.

        <p>Events are a great way to decouple parts of the system in a modular fashion, as
            event observers and producers know nothing about each other, nor do they require
            any configuration for them to do so. You can add pieces of code that subscribe
            to events with the event producer unaware of the observer. (Without using events,
            you would typically need to have the event producer call the observer manually.) For
            example, if someone updates an order status, you could add events to email the
            sales representative, or notify an account manager if a tech support issue is
            open for more than a week. These kinds of rules can be implemented without events,
            but events make it easier to decouple the business logic. Additionally, there is
            no compile or build time dependency. You can just add modules to your application
            and they will automatically start observing and producing events.</p>
