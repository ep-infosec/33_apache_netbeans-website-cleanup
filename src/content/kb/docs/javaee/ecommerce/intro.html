        <p>Welcome to the NetBeans E-commerce Tutorial. In this multi-part tutorial, you
            learn how to create a simple yet effective e-commerce application that demonstrates
            various important features of Java web and EE development. In doing so, you'll
            familiarize yourself with the NetBeans IDE and become capable of applying it to
            your own development purposes.</p>

        <p>Taking the time to master the IDE will ultimately lead you to become more efficient
            and versatile as a developer. While you work through the tutorial units, you'll learn
            how to make best use of the IDE's facilities and tools. These include:</p>

        <ul style="margin-left: 320px" class="toc">
            <li><strong>Editor support for different languages:</strong> syntax highlighting,
                code completion, API documentation support, keyboard shortcuts, refactoring
                capabilities, and code templates</li>

            <li><strong>Window system:</strong> Projects, Files and Services windows, the
                Tasks window, Javadoc window, HTTP Monitor, Navigator and Palette</li>

            <li><strong>Integration with other services: </strong>automatic deployment to
                a registered server, database connectivity, browser interoperability</li>

            <li><strong>Development tools:</strong> Debugger, Profiler, HTTP Server
                Monitor, Local History support, and a graphical Diff Viewer</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The tutorial is modular in fashion, with each unit focusing on specific concepts,
            technologies, and features of the IDE. You can successfully follow a tutorial unit
            on its own using the provided setup instructions and application snapshots (from
            Unit 5 onward). However, you'll get the most benefit by working through all units
            consecutively, from beginning to end. This will also help to illustrate the
            development process.</p>

        <p>Unit 3, <a href="setup-dev-environ.html">Setting up the Development Environment</a>
            introduces you to the NetBeans IDE. In it, you create a Java web project which
            is the basis for the work you undertake in later tutorial units. In Unit 4,
            <a href="data-model.html">Designing the Data Model</a>, you primarily work with
            <a href="http://wb.mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL WorkBench</a>, a visual
            database design tool, to create a data model for the application. Each successive
            tutorial unit provides you with a <em>project snapshot</em> that corresponds to
            the project's beginning state for that given unit. This enables you to work through
            a single tutorial unit outside of the E-commerce Tutorial's larger context. To use
            these snapshots, download them to your computer and open them in the IDE using the
            Open Project wizard (Ctrl-Shift-O; &#8984;-Shift-O on Mac).</p>

        <p>You can view a live demo of the application that you build in this tutorial:

            E-commerce Tutorial Demo Application</a>.</p>

        <p>The remainder of this unit covers some information relevant to the tutorial, as
            well as basic concepts necessary for Java EE development. Make sure you understand
            the concepts outlined below before proceeding with development.</p>

        <h2 id="whatEcommerce">What is an E-commerce Application?</h2>

        <p>The term <em>e-commerce</em>, as we think of it today, refers to the buying and
            selling of goods or services over the Internet. For example, you may think of
            <a href="http://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, which provides online
            shopping for various product categories, such as books, music, and electronics.
            This form of e-commerce is known as electronic retailing, or <em>e-tailing</em>,
            and usually involves the transportation of physical items. It is also referred
            to as <em>business-to-customer</em>, or B2C. Other well-known forms include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consumer-to-consumer (C2C): </strong>Transactions taking place
                between individuals, usually through a third-party site such as an online
                auction. A typical example of C2C commerce is <a href="http://www.ebay.com/" target="_blank">eBay</a>.</li>

            <li><strong>Business-to-business (B2B): </strong>Trade occurring between
                businesses, e.g., between a retailer and wholesaler, or between a wholesaler
                and manufacturer.</li>

            <li><strong>Business-to-government (B2G): </strong>Trade occurring between
                businesses and government agencies.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This tutorial focuses on business-to-customer (B2C) e-commerce, and applies the
            typical scenario of a small retail store seeking to create a website enabling
            customers to shop online. Software that accommodates a B2C scenario generally
            consists of two components:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Store Front:</strong> The website that is accessed by customers,
                enabling them to purchase goods over the Internet. Data from the store catalog
                is typically maintained in a database, and pages requiring this data are
                generated dynamically.</li>

            <li><strong>Administration Console:</strong> A password-protected area that is
                accessed over a secure connection by store staff for purposes of online management.
                This typically involves CRUD (create read update delete) access to the store
                catalog, management of discounts, shipping and payment options, and review
                of customer orders.</li>
        </ol>


        <br>
        <h2 id="whatJava">What is Java?</h2>

        <p>In the computer software industry, the term &quot;Java&quot; refers to the
            <em>Java Platform</em> as well as the <em>Java Programming Language</em>.</p>

            <h3>Java as a Programming Language</h3>

            <p>The Java language was conceptualized by
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling" target="_blank">James Gosling</a>,
                who began work on the project in 1991. The language was created with the following
                5 design principles<sup><a href="#footnote1" id="1" style="text-decoration:none">[1]</a></sup>
                in mind:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Simple, Object-Oriented, and Familiar:</strong> Java contains
                    a small, consistent core of fundamental concepts that can be grasped
                    quickly. It was originally modeled after the then popular C++ language,
                    so that programmers could easily migrate to Java. Also, it adheres to
                    an <em>object-oriented</em> paradigm; systems are comprised of
                    encapsulated objects that communicate by passing messages to one another.</li>

                <li><strong>Robust and Secure:</strong> The language includes compile-time
                    and run-time checking to ensure that errors are identified quickly. It
                    also contains network and file-access security features so that distributed
                    applications are not compromised by intrusion or corruption.</li>

                <li><strong>Architecture Neutral and Portable:</strong> One of Java's primary
                    advantages is its <em>portability</em>. Applications can be easily
                    transferred from one platform to another with minimum or no modifications.
                    The slogan &quot;Write once, run anywhere&quot; accompanied the Java 1.0
                    release in 1995, and refers to the cross-platform benefits of the language.</li>

                <li><strong>High Performance:</strong> Applications run quickly and efficiently
                    due to various low-level features, such as enabling the Java interpreter
                    to run independently from the run-time environment, and applying an
                    automatic garbage collector to free unused memory.</li>

                <li><strong>Interpreted, Threaded, and Dynamic:</strong> With Java, a developer's
                    source code is compiled into an intermediate, interpreted form known as
                    <em>bytecode</em>. The bytecode instructional set refers to the machine
                    language used by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). With a suitable interpreter,
                    this language can then be translated into <em>native code</em> for the
                    platform it is run on. Multithreading capabilities are supported primarily
                    by means of the <code>Thread</code> class, enabling numerous tasks to occur
                    simultaneously. The language and run-time system are dynamic in that
                    applications can adapt to environment changes during execution.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>If you'd like to learn more about the Java language, see
                the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/" target="_blank">Java Tutorials</a>.</p>


            <h3 id="platform">Java as a Platform</h3>

            <p>The Java Platform signifies a software-based platform that is comprised of two
                parts:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</strong>: The JVM is an engine that
                    executes instructions generated by the Java compiler. The JVM can be thought
                    of as an instance of the Java Runtime Environment, or JRE, and is embedded
                    in various products, such as web browsers, servers, and operating systems.</li>

                <li><strong>The Java Application Programming Interface (API)</strong>:
                    Prewritten code, organized into packages of similar topics. For instance,
                    the Applet and AWT packages include classes for creating fonts, menus,
                    and buttons.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The Java Development Kit, or JDK, refers to the Java SE Edition, while other
                kits are referred to as &quot;SDK&quot;, a generic term for &quot;software
                development kit.&quot; For example, the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/sdk/" target="_blank">Java
                EE SDK</a>.<sup><a href="#footnote2" id="2" style="text-decoration:none">[2]</a></sup></p>

            <p>You can see a visual representation of the Java platform by viewing the
                conceptual diagram of component technologies provided in the
                <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/index.html" target="_blank">JDK Documentation</a>.
                As shown below, the diagram is interactive, enabling you click on components
                to learn more about individual technologies.

                <br>
                <img src="../../../../images_www/articles/73/javaee/ecommerce/intro/jdk-diagram.png"
                     class="margin-around" alt="Diagram of JDK 6"
                     title="The Java platform represented by the JDK"></p>

            <p>As the diagram indicates, the JDK includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
                You require the JRE to run software, and you require the JDK to develop
                software. Both can be acquired from
                <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" target="_blank">Java SE Downloads</a>.</p>

            <p>The Java platform comes in several <em>editions</em>, such as
                <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/" target="_blank">Java SE</a> (Standard Edition),
                <a href="http://java.sun.com/javame/index.jsp" target="_blank">Java ME</a> (Micro Edition),
                and <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/" target="_blank">Java EE</a> (Enterprise Edition).</p>


            <h3>Java EE</h3>

            <p>The Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) builds upon the Java SE platform
                and provides a set of technologies for developing and running portable, robust,
                scalable, reliable and secure server-side applications.</p>

            <p>EE technologies are loosely divided into two categories:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/technologies/webapps/" target="_blank">Web application technologies</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/technologies/entapps/" target="_blank">Enterprise application technologies</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Depending on your needs, you may want to use certain technologies from either
                category. For example, this tutorial makes use of
                <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/index.jsp" target="_blank">Servlet</a>,
                <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/" target="_blank">JSP/EL</a>, and
                <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/jstl/" target="_blank">JSTL</a> &quot;web&quot;
                technologies, as well as
                <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/ejb/" target="_blank">EJB</a> and
                <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/technologies/persistence.jsp" target="_blank">JPA</a>
                &quot;enterprise&quot; technologies.</p>

            <p>Java EE currently dominates the market, especially in the financial sector. The following

        <h2 id="jcp">What is the Java Community Process?</h2>

        <p>The <a href="http://jcp.org/" target="_blank">Java Community Process</a> (JCP) is a
            program that manages the development of standard technical specifications for Java
            technology. The JCP catalogs Java Specification Requests (JSRs), which are formal
            proposals that document the technologies which are to be added to the Java platform.
            JSRs are run by an <em>Expert Group</em>, which typically comprises representatives
            of companies that are stakeholders in the industry. The JCP enables Java technology
            to grow and adapt according to the needs and trends of the community.</p>

        <p>The JSRs of technologies used and referred to in this tutorial include the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=52" target="_blank">JSR 52: A Standard Tag Library for JavaServer Pages</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=245" target="_blank">JSR 245: JavaServer Pages 2.1</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=315" target="_blank">JSR 315: Java Servlet 3.0</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=316" target="_blank">JSR 316: Java Platform, Enterprise Edition 6</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=317" target="_blank">JSR 317: Java Persistence 2.0</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=318" target="_blank">JSR 318: Enterprise JavaBeans 3.1</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can use the <a href="http://jcp.org/" target="_blank">JCP website</a> to search for individual JSRs.
            You can also view all current EE technologies (Java EE 6) at:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/technologies/index.jsp" target="_blank">http://java.sun.com/javaee/technologies/index.jsp</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Java EE 5 technologies are listed at:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/technologies/javaee5.jsp" target="_blank">http://java.sun.com/javaee/technologies/javaee5.jsp</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>A JSR's final release provides a <em>reference implementation</em>, which is a free
            implementation of the technology. In this tutorial, you utilize these implementations
            to develop the sample e-commerce application. For example, the GlassFish v3 application
            server, which is included in the standard Java download bundle for
            <a href="https://netbeans.org/downloads/6.8/index.html" target="_blank">NetBeans
            6.8</a>, is the reference implementation of the Java EE 6 platform specification
            (<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=316" target="_blank">JSR 316</a>). As a
            reference implementation for the Java EE platform, it includes reference implementations
            for the technologies included in the platform, such as Servlet, EJB and JPA technologies.</p>


        <br>
        <h2 id="ide">Why use an IDE?</h2>

        <p>Firstly, the term <em>IDE</em> stands for <em>integrated development environment</em>.
            The purpose of an IDE has traditionally been to maximize a developer's productivity
            by providing tools and support such as:</p>

        <ul class="toc">
            <li>a source code editor</li>
            <li>a compiler and build automation tools</li>
            <li>a window system for viewing projects and project artifacts</li>
            <li>integration with other commonly-used services</li>
            <li>debugging support</li>
            <li>profiling support</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Consider what would be necessary if you wanted to create a Java-based web application
            manually. After installing the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" target="_blank">Java
            Development Kit (JDK)</a>, you would need to set up your development environment by
            performing the following steps.<sup><a href="#footnote3" id="3" style="text-decoration:none">[3]</a></sup></p>

        <ol>
            <li>Set your <code>PATH</code> environment variable to point to the JDK installation.</li>

            <li>Download and configure a server that implements the technologies you plan to use.</li>

            <li>Create a development directory where you plan to create and work on the web application(s).
                Furthermore, you are responsible for setting up the application directory structure so
                that it can be understood by the server. (For example, see
                <a href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/code/projectconventions.html#99632" target="_blank">Java
                BluePrints: Strategy for Web Applications</a> for a recommended structure.)</li>

            <li>Set your <code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable to include the development
                directory, as well as any required JAR files.</li>

            <li>Establish a deployment method, i.e., a way to copy resources from your development
                directory to the server's deployment area.</li>

            <li>Bookmark or install relevant API documentation.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>For educative purposes, it is worthwhile to create and run a Java web project manually
            so that you are aware the necessary steps involved. But eventually, you'll want to
            consider using tools that reduce or eliminate the need to perform tedious or repetitious
            tasks, thereby enabling you to focus on developing code that solves specific business
            needs. An IDE streamlines the process outlined above. As demonstrated in Unit 3,
            <a href="setup-dev-environ.html">Setting up the Development Environment</a>, you'll
            install NetBeans IDE with the GlassFish application server, and be able to set up
            a web application project with a conventional directory structure using a simple
            3-step wizard. Furthermore, the IDE provides provides built-in API documentation which
            you can either call up as you code in the editor, or maintain open in an external
            window.</p>

        <p>An IDE also typically handles project compilation and deployment in a way that is
            transparent to you as a developer. For example, the web project that you create in
            NetBeans includes an Ant build script that is used to compile, clean, package and
            deploy the project. This means that you can run your project from the IDE, and it
            will automatically be compiled and deployed, then open in your default browser.
            Taking this a step further, many IDEs support a Deploy on on Save feature. In other
            words, whenever you save changes to your project, the deployed version on your
            server is automatically updated. You can simply switch to the browser and refresh
            the page to view changes.</p>

        <p>IDEs also provide templates for various file types, and often enable you to add them
            to your project by suggesting common locations and including default configuration
            information where necessary.</p>

        <p>Aside from the &quot;basic support&quot; described above, IDEs typically provide
            interfaces to external tools and services (e.g., application and database servers,
            web services, debugging and profiling facilities, and collaboration tools) which
            are indispensable to your work if Java development is your profession.</p>

        <p>Finally, IDEs usually provide enhanced editor support. The editor is where you likely
            spend most of your time working, and IDE editors typically include syntax highlighting,
            refactoring capabilites, keyboard shortcuts, code completion, hints and error messages,
            all aiming to help you work more efficiently and intelligently.</p>

        <h2 id="netBeans">Why use NetBeans?</h2>

        <p>The NetBeans IDE is a free, open-source integrated development environment written
            entirely in Java. It offers a range of tools for create professional desktop,
            enterprise, web, and mobile applications with the Java language, C/C++,
            and even scripting languages such as PHP, JavaScript, Groovy, and Ruby.</p>

        <p>People are saying great things about NetBeans. For a list of testimonials, see
            <a href="../../../../features/ide/testimonials.html" target="_blank">NetBeans IDE
            Testimonials</a>. Many developers are migrating their applications to NetBeans
            from other IDEs. For reasons why, read <a href="../../../../switch/realstories.html" target="_blank">Real
            Stories From People Switching to NetBeans IDE</a>.</p>

        <p>The IDE provides many <a href="../../../../features/web/index.html" target="_blank">features
            for web development</a>, and several advantages over other IDEs. Here are several
            noteworthy points:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Works Out of the Box:</strong> Simply download, install, and run the
                IDE. With its small download size, installation is a breeze. The IDE runs on
                many platforms including Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and Solaris. All IDE tools
                and features are fully integrated - no need to hunt for plug-ins - and they
                work together when you launch the IDE.</li>

            <li><strong>Free and Open Source:</strong> When you use the NetBeans IDE, you join
                a vibrant, <a href="../../../../community/index.html" target="_blank">open source
                community</a> with thousands of users ready to help and contribute. There are
                discussions on the <a href="../../../../community/lists/index.html" target="_blank">NetBeans
                project mailing lists</a>, blogs on <a href="http://www.planetnetbeans.org/" target="_blank">Planet
                NetBeans</a>, and helpful FAQs and tutorials on the <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/" target="_blank">community
                wiki</a>.</li>

            <li><strong>Profiling and Debugging Tools:</strong> With NetBeans IDE
                <a href="../../../../features/java/profiler.html">profiler</a>, you get real time
                insight into memory usage and potential performance bottlenecks. Furthermore, you can
                instrument specific parts of code to avoid performance degradation during profiling.
                The <a href="http://profiler.netbeans.org/docs/help/6.0/heapwalker.html" target="_blank">HeapWalker</a>
                tool helps you evaluate Java heap contents and find memory leaks.</li>

            <li><strong>Customizable Projects:</strong> Through the NetBeans IDE build process, which
                relies on industry standards such as <a href="http://ant.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache
                Ant</a>, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/" target="_blank">make</a>,
                <a href="http://maven.apache.org/" target="_blank">Maven</a>, and
                <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/" target="_blank">rake</a> - rather than a
                proprietary build process - you can easily customize projects and add functionality.
                You can build, run, and deploy projects to servers outside of the IDE.</li>

            <li><strong>Collaboration Tools:</strong> The IDE provides built-in support for version
                control systems such as CVS, Subversion, and Mercurial.</li>

            <li><strong>Extensive Documentation:</strong> There's a wealth of tips and instructions
                contained in the IDE's built-in help set. Simply press F1 (fn-F1 on Mac) on a component
                in the IDE to invoke the help set. Also, the IDE's <a href="../../../index.html" target="_blank">official
                knowledge base</a> provides hundreds of online tutorials, articles and
                <a href="../../../../community/media.html" target="_blank">screencasts</a> that are
                continuously being updated.</li>
        </ul>
