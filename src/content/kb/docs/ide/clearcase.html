        <h1>Using ClearCase Support in NetBeans IDE</h1>

        <p>The IDE's ClearCase support is designed to help you perform versioning
            tasks directly to your project when working in the IDE.</p>

        <p>This document guides you through the basic steps involved in using ClearCase
            in NetBeans IDE.</p>
            
        <p>Rational ClearCase is a version control software tool developed by IBM. ClearCase 
            forms the base of version control for projects of many large and medium-sized 
            businesses.</p>

        <h2>Setting up ClearCase</h2>
        
        <p>Before you can take advantage of the IDE's ClearCase support, you need to have the ClearCase client 
            software installed and running on your computer.</p>

        <p>NetBeans ClearCase support works with both <em>snapshot</em> and <em>dynamic</em> views. <strong>Views have
            to be configured externally from the IDE and a connection to a ClearCase server must be properly 
            set up.</strong> No extra work is needed to access files in snapshot views. If you want to access files
            from a dynamic view however, you must first initiate it with the native ClearCase tools installed 
            on your computer.</p>

        <p><strong class="notes">Notes:</strong></p>   
         
        <ul>
            <li>Currently it is not possible to connect to a ClearCase Web Interface (CCWeb).</li>
            <li>A limitation for *nix-like systems is that you have to start the IDE from a dynamic views 
                context to be able to access your files.</li>
        </ul>
            
        <p>The IDE's ClearCase support works by interacting with the <tt>cleartool</tt> client to carry out 
            versioning commands. Depending on your system, and whether you install the <tt>cleartool</tt> client 
            to a non-default location, you may also need to register the path to the <tt>cleartool</tt> executable 
            in the IDE.</p>           

        <div class="indent">
            <a name="specifying"></a>
            <h3>Specifying the Path to the <tt>cleartool</tt> Executable</h3>

            <p>NetBeans IDE automatically tries to identify the location of the <tt>cleartool</tt>
                executable file by using the <tt>&#36;PATH</tt> system variable on your computer.
                Depending on your platform however, or whether you installed the ClearCase
                client to a different location, it may be necessary to specify the path to
                the executable file explicitly. To set the path to the ClearCase executable
                file in the IDE:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Choose Tools &gt; Options (NetBeans &gt; Preferences on Mac) from the main menu.
                    The Options dialog opens.</li>
                <li>Select the Miscellaneous icon along the top of the dialog, then click the
                    Versioning tab. In the left pane under Versioning Systems, select ClearCase.
                    User-defined options for ClearCase display in the main window of the dialog:

                    <p class="align-center"><a name="ccOptions"></a>               
                    <a href="../../../images_www/articles/74/ide/clearcase/cc-options.jpg" rel="lytebox"

                            class="margin-around"></a></p></li>

                <li>In the Specify the <tt>cleartool</tt> Executable Path text field, either type 
                    in the path to the executable file or click Browse to navigate to it on your 
                    system.</li>
                <li>Click OK, then restart the IDE to allow changes to take effect.</li>
            </ol>
        
            <p><strong class="notes">Note: </strong>For more information see 
                <a href="http://versioncontrol.netbeans.org/clearcase/install.html">NetBeans ClearCase

        </div>

        <a name="starting"></a>
        <h2>Starting to Work with Versioned Files</h2>

        <p>When working with ClearCase in the IDE for the first time, you need to begin by opening an existing
            versioned project, or by creating a new project <strong>within a ClearCase view</strong> on your computer.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="#opening">Opening an Existing Project in the IDE</a> </li>   
            <li><a href="#addingSourceControl">Creating a New Project and Placing it under Source Control</a></li>
        </ul>

        <div class="indent">
            <a name="opening"></a>
            <h3>Opening an Existing Project in the IDE</h3>

            <p>If you already have a ClearCase versioned project which you have been working with, you can open it 
                in the IDE and versioning features will automatically become available to you. The IDE scans your 
                open projects and if they are located in a ClearCase view directory, file status and context-sensitive 
                support automatically become active.</p>

            <p>To open a ClearCase versioned project:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Choose File &gt; Open Project from the main menu and work your way through the Open Project 
                    wizard. When specifying the project location, navigate to the location <strong>within a ClearCase
                    view</strong> directory on your computer. When you complete the wizard, the project displays in the
                    Projects window (Ctrl-1), and versioning support becomes active.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p><strong class="notes">Note: </strong>You can also open a project or directory in the Favorites window. 
                This may be necessary if your ClearCase directory is not a NetBeans project. To do so, right-click in 
                the Favorites window (Ctrl-3) and choose Add to Favorites. In the Add to Favorites dialog that displays, 
                navigate to the top-level ClearCase view directory on your computer and click Add. A tree view of the 
                directory is added to the Favorites window.</p>

            <a name="addingSourceControl"></a>
            <h3>Creating a New Project and Placing it under Source Control</h3>

            <p>Alternately, you can create a new project and place it under ClearCase source control, then continue 
                to work on it in the IDE. When you create a new project, you need to specify its location <strong>within a
                ClearCase view</strong>. This allows the IDE to recognize that versioning support is required. When the project
                is created, all files are initially <em>view-private</em>). You can then add the project to the ClearCase 
                server using the IDE's Add to Source Control command.</p>

            <p>To create a new project:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Choose File &gt; New Project from the main menu and work your way through the New Project wizard.</li> 
                 <li>In Step 2, Name and Location, select a directory in a ClearCase view.</li> 
				 <li>When you click Finish, the 
                    project is created and a tree view of its directory is added to the Projects window (Ctrl-1).<br> Upon 
                    creation, the IDE automatically recognizes that the project is in a view and all relevant ClearCase 
                    actions and file status information become available.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>When a versioned project is opened in the IDE, all file and folder names are rendered green, indicating 
                that they have 'new' status. (Any files displayed in grey have 'ignored' status. See <a href="#badges">Badges
                and Color Encoding</a> below for more information.) The IDE automatically decides for each versioned 
                project file whether it is a candidate for version control or not (i.e., Source files in packages are 
                usually meant to be versioned, whereas project private files are generally ignored).</p>

           <!-- <p><span class="tips"></span>It is possible to to modify the way IDE handles private file views using the 
                following options:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Schedule View Private Files For checkin option in the <a href="#ccOptions">ClearCase Options dialog</a></li>
                <li>Ignored Files setting available under Tools &gt; Options (NetBeans &gt; Preferences on Mac) &gt;
                    Advanced Options &gt; IDE Configuration &gt; System &gt; System Settings &gt; Ignored Files</li>
            </ul>    -->                     

            <p>Now that your project is created, you can synchronize it with a ClearCase server using the IDE's Add to 
                Source Control command:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Right-click the project node in the Projects window and choose Add to source control. The 
                    Add dialog opens listing all new view-private files which are not automatically ignored by 
                    the IDE:

                    <p class="align-center"><a name="addDialog"></a>                
                    <a href="../../../images_www/articles/74/ide/clearcase/add-dialog.jpg" rel="lytebox"
                        title="ClearCase Add dialog lists all files to be added to source control">
                        <img src="../../../images_www/articles/74/ide/clearcase/add-dialog-small.jpg" class="margin-around"
                        alt="ClearCase Add dialog"></a></p></li>

                <li>Type in a message in the Describing Message text area. Alternatively, click the Recent Messages 
                    ( <img src="../../../images_www/articles/74/ide/clearcase/recent-msgs.png" alt="recent messages icon"> ) icon located
                    in the upper right corner to view and select from a list of messages that you have previously used.</li>
                <li>After specifying actions for individual files, click Add. The IDE's status bar, located in the bottom 
                    right of the interface, displays as the Add action takes place. Upon a successful Add, versioning badges 
                    disappear in the Projects, Files and Favorites windows, and the color encoding of checked-in files becomes 
                    black.</li>                    
            </ol>

            <p><strong class="notes">Note: </strong>From the Add dialog, it is possible to specify whether to exclude 
                individual files from the Add action. To do so, click the Action column of a selected file and choose 
                Do not Add from the drop-down list.</p>
        </div>

        <a name="checkingout"></a>
        <h2>Checking out Sources</h2>

        <p>Once you have a ClearCase versioned project opened in the IDE, you can begin making changes to sources. 
            Modifying ClearCase versioned files requires them to be checked out or <em>hijacked</em> first. NetBeans 
            ClearCase support provides two ways to achieve this:</p>

        <ul> 
            <li><strong>Manually</strong>: Simply right-click a file node and choose ClearCase &gt; Checkout 
                (or ClearCase &gt; Hijack).</li>
            <li><strong>Using the On Demand Checkout feature</strong>: Each time an action occurs that requires a file 
                to be writable, the IDE automatically runs the relevant ClearCase command (e.g. changing file contents 
                in the editor for the first time or running a refactoring action).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><span class="tips"></span>The On Demand Checkout feature can be fine-tuned using the On Demand checkout 
            option in <a href="#ccOptions">ClearCase Options dialog</a>.</p>

        <a name="editing"></a>
        <h2>Editing Sources</h2>

        <p>As with any project opened in NetBeans IDE, you can open files in the Source Editor by double-clicking 
            their nodes, as they appear in the IDE's windows (e.g. Projects (Ctrl-1), Files (Ctrl-2), Favorites (Ctrl-3) 
            windows).</p>

        <p>When working with sources in the IDE, there are various UI components at your disposal, which aid in both 
            viewing and operating version control commands:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="#viewingChanges">Viewing Changes in the Source Editor</a></li>
            <li><a href="#viewingFileStatus">Viewing File Status Information</a></li>
            <li><a href="#comparing">Comparing File Versions</a></li>        
        </ul>

        <div class="indent">
            <a name="viewingChanges"></a>
            <h3>Viewing Changes in the Source Editor</h3>

            <p>When you open a versioned file in the IDE's Source Editor, you can view real-time changes occurring to 
                your file as you modify it against your previously checked-out version from the repository. As you work, 
                the IDE uses color encoding in the Source Editor's margins to convey the following information:</p>

            <table class="cell">
                <tr>
                    <td class="align-right cell"><strong>Blue</strong>
                        ( <span style="background-color:#b8cfe5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> )</td>
                    <td>Indicates lines that have been changed since the earlier version.</td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="align-right cell"><strong>Green</strong>
                        ( <span style="background-color:#b4ffb4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> )</td>
                    <td>Indicates lines that have been added since the earlier version.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="align-right cell"><strong>Red</strong>
                        ( <span style="background-color:#ffa0b4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> )</td>

                    <td>Indicates lines that have been removed since the earlier version.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>The Source Editor's left margin shows changes occurring on a line-by-line basis. When you modify a 
                given line, changes are immediately shown in the left margin.</p>

            <p>You can click on a color grouping in the margin to revert the newly made changes. For example, the 
                screen capture below left shows widgets available to you when clicking a red icon, indicating that 
                lines have been removed from your checked out file.</p>

            <p>The Source Editor's right margin provides you with an overview that displays changes made to your 
                file as a whole, from top to bottom. Color encoding is generated immediately when you make changes 
                to your file.</p>

            <p>Note that you can click on a specific point within the margin to bring your inline cursor immediately 
                to that location in the file. To view the number of lines affected, hover your mouse over the colored 
                icons in the right margin:</p>

            <h3>Viewing File Status Information</h3>

            <p>When you are working in the Projects (Ctrl-1), Files (Ctrl-2), Favorites (Ctrl-3), or Versioning 
                windows, the IDE provides several visual features that aid in viewing status information about 
                your files. In the example below, notice how the badge (e.g. <img src="../../../images_www/articles/74/ide/clearcase/blue-badge.png"
                alt="blue badge">), color of the file name, and adjacent status label, all coincide with each 
                other to provide you with a simple but effective way to keep track of versioning information on 
                your files:</p>

                    <p class="align-center">
                    <img src="../../../images_www/articles/74/ide/clearcase/badge-example.jpg" class="b-all margin-around"

                        alt="blue versioning badge displayed in Favorites window"></p>

            <p>Badges, color coding, file status labels, and perhaps most importantly, the Versioning window all 
                contribute to your ability to effectively view and manage and versioning information in the IDE.</p>

                <h4>Badges and Color Coding</h4>

                <p>Badges are applied to project, folder, and package nodes and inform you of the status of files contained

                <h4>File Status Labels</h4>

                <p>File status labels provide a textual indication of the status of versioned files in the IDE's windows. 
                    By default, the IDE displays status (new, reserved, unreserved, ignored, etc.) information in gray text 
                    to the right of files, as they are listed in windows. You can, however, modify this format to suit
                    your own needs. For example, if you want to add version selectors to status labels, do the following:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Choose Tools &gt; Options (NetBeans &gt; Preferences on Mac) from the main menu. The Options
                        window opens.</li>
                    <li>Select the Miscellaneous button along the top of the window, then click the Versioning tab beneath 
                        it. Make sure ClearCase is selected beneath Versioning Systems in the left panel. (See the above 
                        <a href="#ccOptions">screen capture</a> for reference.)</li>
                    <li>Click the Add Variable button to the right of the status label Format text field. In the Add Variable 
                        dialog that displays, select the <tt>{version}</tt> variable, then click OK. The version variable
                        is added to the status label Format text field.</li>
                    <li>To reformat status labels so that only status and version selector display to the right of files, 
                        rearrange the contents of the Status Label Format text field to the following:<br>

                        <pre class="examplecode">[{status}; {version}]</pre>

                        Click OK. Status labels now list file status and version selector (where applicable):

                <h4>The Versioning Window</h4>

                <p>The ClearCase Versioning window provides you with a real-time list of all of the changes made to files 
                    within a selected folder of your local working copy. It opens by default in the bottom panel of the IDE, 
                    listing new, checked out, or hijacked files.</p>

                <p>To open the Versioning window, select a versioned file or folder (e.g. from the Projects, Files, or 
                    Favorites window) and either choose ClearCase &gt; Show Changes from the right-click menu, or choose 
                    Versioning &gt; Show Changes from the main menu. The following window appears in the bottom of the IDE:</p>

                    <p class="align-center">

                <p>By default, the Versioning window displays a list of all files within the selected package or folder 
                    that exhibit a noteworthy status (i.e., new, reserved, unreserved, etc.). You can click the column 
                    headings above the listed files to sort the files by name, status, location or rule.</p>

                <p>The Versioning window toolbar also includes buttons that enable you to invoke the most common ClearCase 
                    tasks on all files displayed in the list. The following table lists the ClearCase commands available in 
                    the toolbar of the Versioning window:</p>

                <p>You can access other ClearCase commands in the Versioning window by selecting a table row that

        <h3>Comparing File Versions</h3>

        <p>Comparing file versions is a common task when working with versioned projects. The IDE enables you 
            to compare versions by using the Diff command, which is available from the right-click menu of a 
            selected item (ClearCase &gt; Diff), as well as from the Versioning window. In the Versioning window, 
            you can perform diffs by either double-clicking a listed file, otherwise you can click the Diff All 
            icon (<img alt="diff all icon" src="../../../images_www/articles/74/ide/clearcase/diff.png">) located in the
            toolbar at the top.</p>

        <p>When you perform a diff, a graphical Diff Viewer opens for the selected file(s) in the IDE's main 
            window. The Diff Viewer displays two copies in side-by-side panels:</p>

           <p class="align-center">
            <a href="../../../images_www/articles/74/ide/clearcase/diff-viewer.jpg" rel="lytebox"
                title="ClearCase Diff Viewer">
                <img src="../../../images_www/articles/74/ide/clearcase/diff-viewer-small.jpg"
                    class="b-all margin-around" alt="ClearCase Diff Viewer"></a></p>

        <p>The Diff Viewer makes use of the same <a href="#viewingChanges">color encoding</a> used elsewhere to 
            display version control changes. In the screen capture displayed above, the green block indicates 
            content that has been added to the more current version. The red block indicates that content from 
            the earlier version has been removed from the later.  Blue indicates that changes have occurred within 
            the highlighted line(s).</p>

        <p>Also, when performing a diff on a group of files, such as on a project, package, or folder, or when 
            clicking Diff All (<img src="../../../images_www/articles/74/ide/clearcase/diff.png" alt="diff all icon">), you
            can switch between diffs by clicking files listed in the upper region of the Diff Viewer.</p>

        <p>The Diff Viewer also provides you with the following functionality:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="#makeChanges">Make Changes to your checked out file</a></li>
            <li><a href="#navigateDifferences">Navigate Among Differences</a></li>            
        </ul>

        <div class="indent">
            <a name="makeChanges"></a>
            <h4>Make Changes to your checked out file</h4>

            <p>If you are performing a diff on checked out files, it is possible to make changes directly from 
                within the Diff Viewer. To do so, you can either place your cursor within the right pane of the 
                Diff Viewer and modify your file accordingly, otherwise make use of the inline icons that display 
                adjacent to each highlighted change:</p>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td class="align-right cell" style="width:120px"><strong>Replace</strong> (<img alt="replace icon"

                    <td>Inserts the highlighted text from the previous versions into the checked out version</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="align-right cell" style="width:120px"><strong>Move All</strong> (<img alt="move all icon"
                        src="../../../images_www/articles/74/ide/clearcase/arrow.png">):</td>
                    <td>Reverts the file's checkedout version to the state of the selected previous version</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="align-right cell" style="width:120px"><strong>Remove</strong> (<img alt="remove icon"
                        src="../../../images_www/articles/74/ide/clearcase/remove.png">):</td>
                    <td>Removes the highlighted text from the checked out version so that it mirrors the previous version</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <a name="navigateDifferences"></a>
            <h4>Navigate among Differences between Compared Files</h4>

            <p>If your diff contains multiple differences, you can navigate among them by using the arrow icons 
                displayed in the toolbar. The arrow icons enable you to view differences as they appear from top 
                to bottom:</p>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td class="align-right cell" style="width:120px"><strong>Previous</strong>
                        (<img src="../../../images_www/articles/74/ide/clearcase/diff-prev.png" alt="previous difference button">):</td>
                    <td>Goes to previous difference displayed in the diff</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td class="align-right cell" style="width:120px"><strong>Next</strong>
                        (<img src="../../../images_www/articles/74/ide/clearcase/diff-next.png" alt="next difference button">):</td>
                    <td>Goes to next difference displayed in the diff</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>

        <a name="checkingin"></a>
        <h2>Checking in Sources</h2>

        <p>After making changes to sources, you check them in to the repository. The IDE enables you to call the 
            checkin command in the following ways:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>From the Projects, Files or Favorites windows, right-click new or checked-out items and choose 
                ClearCase &gt; Checkin.</li>

            <li>From the Versioning window or Diff Viewer, click the Checkin All (<img src="../../../images_www/articles/74/ide/clearcase/commit.png"
                alt="checkin all icon">) button located in the toolbar.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Checkin dialog opens, listing:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>all checked-out files</li>
            <li>all new files, which will be automatically added to source control first (i.e., view-private files 
                which are not yet versioned and are not ignored by the IDE).</li>
        </ul>        

        <p class="align-center">
            <a href="../../../images_www/articles/74/ide/clearcase/checkin-dialog.png" rel="lytebox"
                title="Checkin dialog displays files about to be checked in">
                <img src="../../../images_www/articles/74/ide/clearcase/checkin-dialog-small.png"
                    class="margin-around" alt="Checkin dialog displaying files about to be checked in"></a>
        </p>

        <p>From the Checkin dialog, it is possible to specify whether to exclude individual files from the checkin. 
            To do so, click the Checkin Action column of a selected file and choose Exclude from Checkin from the 
            drop-down list.</p>

        <p>To perform the checkin:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Type in a checkin message in the Checkin Message text area. Alternatively, click the Recent Messages 
                ( <img src="../../../images_www/articles/74/ide/clearcase/recent-msgs.png" alt="recent messages icon"> ) icon located
                in the upper right corner to view and select from a list of messages that you have previously used.</li>

            <li>After specifying actions for individual files, click Checkin. The IDE executes the checkin. The 
                IDE's status bar, located in the bottom right of the interface, displays as the checkin action 
                takes place. Upon a successful checkin, versioning badges disappear in the Projects, Files and 
                Favorites windows, and the color encoding of checked-in files returns to black.</li>
        </ol>
