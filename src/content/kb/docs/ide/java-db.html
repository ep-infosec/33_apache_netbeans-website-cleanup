        <h1>Working with the Java DB (Derby) Database</h1>

        <p>This document demonstrates how to set up a connection to  
            <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javadb/overview/index.html">Java&nbsp;DB</a>
            database in NetBeans IDE. Once a connection is made, you can begin working 
            with the database in the IDE, allowing you to create tables, populate them 
            with data, run SQL statements and queries, and more.</p>
        
        <p>The Java&nbsp;DB database is Sun's supported distribution of 
            <a href="http://db.apache.org/derby/">Apache Derby</a>. 
            Java&nbsp;DB is a fully transactional, secure, standards-based database 
            server, written entirely in Java, and fully supports SQL, JDBC API, and 
            Java EE technology. The Java&nbsp;DB database is packaged with the 
            <a href="http://glassfish.dev.java.net/">GlassFish</a> application server,
            and is included in <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/">JDK&nbsp;6</a> 
            as well. For more information on Java&nbsp;DB database, consult the 
            <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javadb/documentation/index.html">official
            documentation</a>.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Java DB is installed when you install JDK 7 or JDK 8 (except on Mac OS X).
                If you are using Mac OS X you can download and install 
                <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javadb/downloads/index.html">Java&nbsp;DB</a> manually
                or use the Java DB that is installed by Java EE version of the NetBeans IDE installer.</li>
        </ul>

        <a name="configuring"></a>
        <h2>Configuring the Database</h2>
        
        <p>If you have the GlassFish Server registered in your NetBeans IDE installation, 
            Java&nbsp;DB will already be registered for you. Therefore, you can skip ahead to 
            <a href="#starting">Starting the Server and Creating a Database</a>. </p>
        <p>If you downloaded the GlassFish server separately and need help registering it in NetBeans IDE,
            see <strong>Registering a GlassFish Server Instance</strong> in the IDE's Help Contents (F1). </p>
        <p>If you just downloaded Java&nbsp;DB on its own, perform the following steps.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Run the self-extracting file. A folder named 'javadb' will be created in 
                the same location as the file. If you just downloaded Java&nbsp;DB and 
                want to have the database server reside in a different location than 
                where it was extracted to, you should relocate it now.</li>
            <li>On your system, create a new directory to be used as a home directory for the individual instances of the database server.
                For example, you can create this folder in the Java&nbsp;DB root directory (javadb) or in any other location.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Before continuing further, it is important to understand the components found 
            in Java&nbsp;DB's root directory:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The <tt>demo</tt> subdirectory contains the demonstration programs.</li>
            <li>The <tt>bin</tt> subdirectory contains the scripts for executing utilities 
                and setting up the environment.</li>
            <li>The <tt>javadoc</tt> subdirectory contains the API documentation that was 
                generated from source code comments.</li>
            <li>The <tt>docs</tt> subdirectory contains the Java&nbsp;DB documentation.</li>
            <li>The <tt>lib</tt> subdirectory contains the Java&nbsp;DB jar files.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <a name="registering"></a>
        <h2>Registering the Database in NetBeans IDE</h2>
        
        <p>Now that the database is configured, perform the following steps to register Java DB in the IDE.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>In the Services window, right-click the Java DB Database node and choose Properties
            to open the Java&nbsp;DB Settings dialog box.</li>
            <li>For the Java&nbsp;DB Installation text field, enter the path to the 
                Java&nbsp;DB root directory (javadb) that you specified in the previous step.</li>
            <li>For Database Location, use the default location if a location is already provided. Click OK
                <p>For example, the default location might look like <tt>C:\Documents and Settings\username\.netbeans-derby</tt> on a Windows machine.</p>
                
                <img src="../../../images_www/articles/72/ide/java-db/javadb-props.png" alt="Java DB settings dialog" title="example of default settings of Java DB server and database" class="margin-around b-all">
                <p class="notes"><strong>Note.</strong> If the Database Location field is empty 
                    you will need to set the path to the directory that contains your databases.
                    You will need to create a directory for the databases if no directory exists.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <a name="starting"></a>
        <h2>Starting the Server and Creating a Database</h2>
        
        <p>The Java&nbsp;DB Database menu options are displayed when you right-click the Java DB node in the Services window.  This 
            contextual menu items allow you to start and stop the database server,  create a new database 
            instance, as well as register database servers in the IDE (as demonstrated in the 
            previous step). To start the database server:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>In the Services window, right-click the Java&nbsp;DB node and choose Start Server. Note 
                the following output in the Output window, indicating that the server has started:<br>
              <img src="../../../images_www/articles/72/ide/java-db/output-start-db.png" class="margin-around b-all"  
                    alt="Output window display after starting the database server">
            </li>
            <li>Right-click the Java&nbsp;DB node and choose Create Database to open the Create Java&nbsp;DB Database dialog.</li>
            <li>Type <tt>contact</tt> for the Database Name.</li>
            <li>Type <tt>nbuser</tt> for the User Name and Password. Click OK.<br>
                <img src="../../../images_www/articles/72/ide/java-db/javadb-createdb.png" class="margin-around b-all" alt="Create Java DB Database dialog" >
                <p class="notes"><strong>Note.</strong> The Database Location is the default location set during installation of Java DB from GlassFish. 
                    If you installed Java DB separately, this location might be different.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>After you create the database, if you expand the Databases node in the Services window
        you can see that the IDE created a database connection and that the database was added to 
        the list under the Java DB node.</p>
         
        <a name="connecting"></a>
        <h2>Connecting to the Database</h2>
        
        <p>So far, you have successfully started the the database server and created a 
            database instance named <tt>contact</tt> in the IDE. 
            In the Services window of the IDE you can perform 
            the following common tasks on database structures.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>creating, deleting, modifying tables</li>
                <li>populating tables with data</li>
                <li>viewing tabular data</li>                                
                <li>executing SQL statements and queries</li>
            </ul>
            
        <p>In order to begin working with the <tt>contact</tt> database, you need to 
            create a connection to it. 
            To connect to the <tt>contact</tt> database perform the following steps.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Expand the Databases node in the Services window and locate the new database and the database connection nodes.
                <p>The database connection node(
            <img src="../../../images_www/articles/72/ide/java-db/connection-node-icon.png" 
                alt="connection node icon">) is displayed under the Databases node. 
                    The name of the database is displayed under the Java DB node.</p>
               
                <img src="../../../images_www/articles/72/ide/java-db/services-window.png" class="margin-around b-all" 
                    alt="contact database in Services window" ><br>
                <p class="notes"><strong>Note.</strong> You will also see the <code>sample [app on APP]</code> database
                    connection that is the default database schema.</p>
          
            <li><p> Right-click the <strong>contact</strong> database connection node 
                (<tt>jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/contact [nbuser on NBUSER]</tt>) 
                and choose Connect.</p>
            The connection node icon appears whole (
            <img src="../../../images_www/articles/72/ide/java-db/connection-node-icon.png" 
                alt="connection node icon">), signifying that the connection was successful.                </li>
            
          <li>Create a convenient display name for the database by right-clicking the database connection 
              node (<tt>jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/contact [nbuser on NBUSER]</tt>) and choosing Rename. 
              Type <tt>Contact DB</tt> in the text field and click OK.</li>
        </ol>		

        <a name="creating"></a>
        <h2>Creating Tables</h2>        
        
        <p>The <tt>contact</tt> database that you just created is currently empty. It does
            not yet contain any tables or data. In NetBeans IDE you can add a database table 
            by either using the Create Table dialog, or by inputting an SQL statement and 
            running it directly from the SQL Editor. You can explore both methods:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#createTable">Using the Create Table Dialog</a></li>
            <li><a href="#sqlEditor">Using the SQL Editor</a></li>
        </ul>

        <div class="indent">
            <a name="createTable"></a>
            <h3>Using the Create Table Dialog</h3>    

            <ol>
                <li>
              <p>Expand the <tt>Contact DB</tt> connection node and note that there are several schema subnodes. The app schema is the only schema that applies to this tutorial. Right-click the APP node and choose Set as Default Schema.</li>
                <li>Expand the APP node and note that there are three
                    subfolders: Tables, Views and Procedures. 
                    Right-click the Tables node and choose Create Table to open the Create Table dialog box.</li>
                <li>In the Table Name text field, type <tt>FRIENDS</tt>.</li>
                <li>Click Add Column. The Add Column dialog box appears. </li>
                <li>For Column Name, enter <tt>id</tt>. For Data Type, select <tt>INTEGER</tt> from the drop-down list. </li>
                <li>Under Constraints, select the Primary Key checkbox to specify that this column is the primary key for your table. All tables found in relational databases 
                  must contain a primary key. Note that when you select the Primary Key check box, 
                  the Index and Unique check boxes are also automatically selected and the 
                  Null check box is deselected. This is because primary keys are used to 
                  identify a unique row in the database, and by default are used as the 
                  table index. Because all rows must be identified, primary keys cannot 
                  contain a <tt>Null</tt> value.<br>

                    A blank canvas opens in the SQL Editor in the main window.</li>
                <li>Enter the following query in the SQL Editor. This is a table definition for 
                    the COLLEAGUES table you are about to create:

                <pre class="examplecode">CREATE TABLE &quot;COLLEAGUES&quot; (

                    <p class="notes"><strong>Note: </strong>Statements and queries formed in the SQL 
                    Editor are parsed in Structured Query Language. SQL adheres to strict 
                    syntax rules which you should be familiar with when working in the 
                    IDE's editor. SQL syntax can also differ depending on the database 
                    management system. See the

        <h2>Adding Table Data</h2>     

        <p>Now that you have created one or more tables in the <tt>contact</tt> database, 
            you can start populating it with data. 
            There are several ways that you can add records to your table.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#sqlstatement">Write an SQL statement</a> in the SQL Editor that supplies a value 
            for every field present in the table schema. </li>
          <li><a href="#usesqleditor">Use the SQL Editor</a> to add records to the table.</li>
          <li><a href="#using">Use an external SQL script</a> to import records to the table. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Read the sections below to learn how to use all these methods of populating the<tt> FRIENDS</tt> table with data.  </p>
        <h3><a name="sqlstatement"></a>Running an SQL Statement </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Expand the Tables under the <tt>Contact DB</tt> node in the Services window, right-click the <tt>FRIENDS</tt> table and choose Execute
                Command to open the SQL Editor window.</li>
            <li>In the SQL Editor, enter the following statement.
              <pre class="examplecode">INSERT INTO APP.FRIENDS VALUES (1,'Theodore','Bagwell','T-Bag','2004-12-25','tbag@foxriver.com')</pre>
              <p class="tips">While you are typing, you can use the SQL Editor code completion.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Right-click inside the SQL Editor and choose Run Statement. The Output 
                window displays a message indicating that the statement was successfully 
                executed.</li>

            <li>To verify that the new record has been added to the <tt>FRIENDS</tt> table, 
                right-click the <tt>FRIENDS</tt> table node in the Services window and choose View Data.
                <p>When you 
            choose View Data, a query to select all the data from the table is 
            automatically generated in the upper pane of the SQL Editor. The 
            results of the statement are displayed in the lower pane of the SQL 
            Editor. In this case, the <tt>FRIENDS</tt> table displays in the lower pane. 
                Note that a new row has been added with the data you just supplied 
                from the SQL statement.</p>

              
          <img src="../../../images_www/articles/72/ide/java-db/new-record.png"

        <h3><a name="usesqleditor"></a>Using the SQL Editor </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Right-click the <tt>FRIENDS</tt> table node and choose View Data (if you have not done this at the last step of the previous section). </li>
          <li>Click the Insert Record(s) (<tt>Alt-I</tt>) button to add a row.<br>
          The Insert Records dialog box appears.</li>
          <li>Click in each cell and enter records. Note that for the cells with Date data type, you can choose a date from the calendar. Click OK when you  are done. <br>
		  <img src="../../../images_www/articles/72/ide/java-db/insert-records.png" 
                    class="margin-around b-all" alt="new records added to FRIENDS table"><br>
          In the SQL Editor, you can sort the results by clicking on a row header, modify and delete existing records, and see the SQL script for the actions you are doing in the editor (the Show SQL Script command from the pop-up menu). </li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="deleting"></a>
        Deleting Tables
        </h2>
        <p>In the following step, you use an external SQL script to create a new 
            <tt>COLLEAGUES</tt> table. However, you just created a <tt>COLLEAGUES</tt> 
            table in the <a href="#sqlEditor">Using the SQL Editor</a> section above. In order
            to make it clear that the SQL script indeed creates a new table, you can
            delete the already created <tt>COLLEAGUES</tt> table now. To delete a 
            database table perform the following steps.</p>
            
        <ol>
            <li>Expand the Tables node under the database connection node in the Services window.</li>
            <li>Right-click the table that you want to delete and choose Delete.</li>
        </ol>
 
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using an External SQL Script</h2>
        <p>Issuing commands from an external SQL script is a popular way to manage your 
            database. You may have already created an SQL script elsewhere, and want to
            import it into NetBeans IDE to run it on a specified database.</p>
        
        <p>In this exercise the script will create a new table named <tt>COLLEAGUES</tt> and populate it with data. 
            Perform the following steps to run the script on the <tt>contact</tt> database.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Download <a href="https://netbeans.org/project_downloads/usersguide/colleagues.sql" target="_blank">colleagues.sql</a>
            to your local system</li>
            <li>Choose File &gt; Open File from the IDE's main menu. In the file 
                browser navigate to the location of the saved <tt>colleagues.sql</tt> 
                file and click Open. The script automatically opens in the SQL Editor.
                <p class="tips">Alternatively, you can copy the contents of <a href="https://netbeans.org/project_downloads/usersguide/colleagues.sql" target="_blank">colleagues.sql</a>
                and then open the SQL editor and paste the contents of the file into the SQL editor.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Make sure your connection to <tt>Contact DB </tt> is selected from the 
                Connection drop-down box in the tool bar at the top of the editor.<br>

            <li>Click the Run SQL (<img src="../../../images_www/articles/72/ide/java-db/run-sql-button.png" alt="run SQL button">) 
                button in the SQL Editor's task bar. The script is executed against the 
                selected database, and any feedback is generated in the Output window.</li>
            
            <li>To verify changes, right-click the <tt>Contact DB </tt> connection node in the 
                Services window and choose Refresh. Note that the new 
                <tt>COLLEAGUES</tt> table from the SQL script now displays as a table node 
                under <tt>contact</tt> in the Services window.</li>
            
            <li>To view the data contained in the new tables, right-click the <tt>COLLEAGUES</tt> table and choose View Data. In 
                this manner, you can also compare the tabular data with the data contained 
                in the SQL script to see that they match.</li>

        <h2><a name="recreating"></a>
        Recreating Tables from a Different Database
        </h2>
        <p>If you have a table from another database which you would like to recreate in 
            the database you are working in from NetBeans IDE, the IDE offers a handy tool 
            for this. You first need to have the second database registered in the IDE, similar 
            to what was described at the beginning of this tutorial. For the purposes of this
            tutorial, use the <tt>sample</tt> database that comes packaged with Java&nbsp;DB. 
            This process is essentially carried out in two parts: You first 
            'grab' the table definition of the selected table, then you can recreate the 
            table in your chosen database:</p>
            
        <ol>
            <li>Connect to the <tt>sample</tt> database by right-clicking the connection node 
                under the Databases node in the Services window and choosing Connect (username and password is <tt>app</tt>).</li>           
            <li>
                <p>Expand the Tables node under the <tt>sample</tt> database connection, right-click the <tt>CUSTOMER</tt> table node and 
                choose Grab Structure.</p>
            
                
                <img src="../../../images_www/articles/72/ide/java-db/grab-structure.png" 
                    alt="Grab Structure menu item displayed in the Services window"
                    class="margin-around b-all"></li> 
 
            <li>In the Grab Table dialog that opens, specify a location on your computer to save 
                the grab file that will be created. Click Save. 
                <p>The grab file records the table definition of the selected table.</p></li>
            <li>Expand the APP schema node under the <tt>Contact DB</tt> database connection, right-click the Tables node
                and choose Recreate Table to open the Recreate Table dialog box.</li>
            <li><p>In the Recreate Table dialog box, navigate to the location where you saved 
                the <tt>CUSTOMER</tt> grab file and click Open to open the Name the Table dialog box.</p>
               
                    <img src="../../../images_www/articles/72/ide/java-db/recreate-table.png" class="margin-around b-all" 
                    alt="Name the Table dialog containing table definition for CUSTOMER"></li> 
            <li>
              <p>At this point you can change the table name or edit the table definition. Otherwise, 
                click OK to immediately create the table in the <tt>contact</tt> database. A new 
                <tt>CUSTOMER</tt> table node appears beneath the <tt>Contact</tt> DB connection node.</p>           
                
              
                <img src="../../../images_www/articles/72/ide/java-db/new-customer-node.png" 
                class="margin-around b-all" alt="new CUSTOMER table node displayed in Services window"></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>If you view the data in the new <tt>CUSTOMER</tt> table you will see that there
        are no records in the database, but that the structure of the table is identical to the
        table that you grabbed.</p>

        <p>This concludes the Working with the Java&nbsp;DB (Derby) Database tutorial. This 
            tutorial demonstrated how to set up a connection to the Java&nbsp;DB database 
            in NetBeans IDE. It then demonstrated how to create, view, modify and delete tables
            in the IDE's Services window. It also showed how 
            work with the SQL Editor to add data to tables, and use the IDE's functionality
            allowing you to recreate tables using definitions from other databases.</p>
