        <h1>Using CVS Support in NetBeans IDE</h1>
        
        <p>NetBeans IDE's CVS support is designed to help streamline the development 
            process for groups working from a shared repository, enabling you to perform 
            versioning tasks directly from your project system within the IDE. The CVS 
            client software comes bundled with NetBeans IDE, and no special setup is 
            necessary in order to begin using CVS.</p>
        
        <p>This document demonstrates how to perform basic versioning tasks in the IDE by 
            guiding you through the standard workflow when using versioning software.</p>
            
        <p>CVS, or Concurrent Versions System, is an open-source version control system 
            that keeps track of all work and changes in a set of files. This is typically 
            used during the implementation of a software project, allowing multiple 
            developers to collaborate. For more information about CVS, consult the 
            <a href="http://ximbiot.com/cvs/">official documentation</a>.</p>
		<p class="notes"><b>Note:</b> After NetBeans IDE 7.0.1, CVS support is  available after installing the CVS plugin from the NetBeans IDE Update Center. Please see the <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/CVSSupport">CVS FAQ</a> page for details.</p>

        <h2>Synchronizing Local Files with a Repository</h2>
        
        <p>When using a version control system, you work by synchronizing local files
            with a repository, making changes to your local copy, then committing them to 
            the repository. The following list describes various ways you can synchronize 
            a project in NetBeans IDE, depending on your specific situation:</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#opening">Opening a CVS Project in the IDE</a></li>
            <li><a href="#checking">Checking out Files from a Repository</a></li>
            <li><a href="#importing">Importing Files into a Repository</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="indent">
            <a name="opening"></a>
            <h3>Opening a CVS Project in the IDE</h3>

            <p>If you already have a CVS versioned project which you have been working 
                with outside of the IDE, you can open it in the IDE and versioning features 
                will automatically become available to you. The IDE scans your open projects 
                and if they contain <code>CVS</code> directories, file status and context-sensitive
                support automatically becomes active for CVS versioned projects.</p> 

            <a name="checking"></a>
            <h3>Checking out Files from a Repository</h3>

            <p>If you want to connect to a remote repository from the IDE, then check out 
                files and immediately begin working with them, do the following:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>In NetBeans IDE, choose Team &gt; CVS &gt; Checkout from
                    the main menu. The Checkout wizard opens.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong class="notes">Note: </strong>The IDE's drop-down menus are 
                    context-sensitive, i.e., the available options depend on the item 
                    currently selected. Therefore, if you are already working within a 
                    CVS project, you can choose Versioning &gt; Checkout from the main menu.</li>
                <li>In the first panel of the wizard, enter the location of the repository
                    as can be defined by <code>CVSROOT</code>:
                    
                    <br><br>                    
                    <a name="protocolTypes"></a>
                    The IDE supports a number of <code>CVSROOT</code> formats, depending on
                    whether the CVS repository is local or remote, and what method you 
                    are using to connect to it:
                    
                    <br><br>

                        </tr>
                        <tr>

                            <td class="tbltd1">Remote password server</td>
                            <td class="tbltd1"><code>:pserver:username@hostname:/repository_path</code></td>

                            <td class="tbltd1"><strong>local</strong></td>
                            <td class="tbltd1">Access to a local repository</td>

                        </tr>

                    <br>
                    Depending on the method you are using you may need to specify other 
                    information, such as a password and proxy settings for connecting to 
                    a remote repository (e.g. for <code>pserver</code>). Click Next.

                <li>In the Modules to Checkout panel of the wizard, specify the module 
                    that you want to check out in the Module field. If you do not know 
                    the name of the module you want to check out, click the Browse button 
                    to view the repository's contents. From the Browse CVS Module dialog 
                    that appears, select any of the listed modules and click OK. Your
                    selection is then added to the Module field:

                <li>In the Branch text field, enter the name of the branch to checkout. 
                    You can click the Browse button to open the Browse Tags dialog box to 
                    search for available branches and tags. If you do not specify a branch 
                    or tag, the <em>trunk</em> is checked out.</li>
                <li>In the Local Folder field, enter a location on your computer where you want 
                    files to be checked out to, then click Finish to initiate the CVS check out.
                    The IDE checks out the specified sources and the IDE's status bar displays 
                    in the lower right corner, indicating progress of the files downloading from 
                    the repository to your local directory. You can also view files as they are 
                    being checked out from the Output window (Ctrl-4).
                    
                    <br><br>
                    <strong class="notes">Note: </strong>If the checked out sources contain 
                    NetBeans projects, a dialog appears prompting you to open them in the IDE. 
                    If the sources do not contain a project, the dialog appears prompting you 
                    to create a new project from the sources and then open them in the IDE. 
                    If you create a new project for such sources, select the appropriate 
                    project category (i.e., in the New Project wizard) and then use the With
                    Existing Sources option within that category.</li>

            <h3>Importing Files into a Repository</h3>        

            <p>Alternately, you can import a project you have been working on in the IDE to
                a remote repository, then continue to work on it in the IDE after it has 
                become versioned with the CVS repository.</p>

            <p><strong class="notes">Note: </strong>While you are actually <em>exporting</em>
                files from your system, the term 'import' is used in version control systems 
                to signify that files are being <em>imported into</em> a repository.</p>
            
            <p>To import a project to a repository:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>From the Projects window (Ctrl-1), select an unversioned project and 
                    choose Versioning &gt; Import into CVS Repository from the 
                    node's right-click menu. The CVS Import wizard opens.</li>
                <li>In the CVS Root panel of the Import wizard, specify the location of 
                    the repository as defined by <a href="#protocolTypes"><code>CVSROOT</code></a>.
                    Depending on the method you are using you may need to specify other 
                    information, such as a password and proxy settings for connecting to 
                    a remote repository (e.g. for <code>pserver</code>). Click Next.</li>
                <li>In the Folder to Import panel, specify the local folder you want to 
                    place in the repository. The name of your project is suggested for 
                    you in the Folder to Import text field by default:

                <li>Specify the location in the repository where you want to import the 
                    project by typing in the path in the Repository Folder text field. 
                    Alternatively, click the Browse button to navigate to a specific 
                    location in the repository. Click Finish to initiate the import. 
                    The IDE uploads the project files to the repository and the Output 
                    window opens to display the progress.</li>

            <p><strong class="notes">Note: </strong>The CVS client does not handle binary file imports 
                by default. The best practice for importing binary sources is to create a <code>cvswrappers</code>

        <h2>Editing Sources</h2>
        
        <p>Once you have a CVS versioned project opened in the IDE, you can begin 
            making changes to sources. As with any project opened in NetBeans IDE, you can 
            open files in the Source Editor by double-clicking on their nodes, as they
            appear in the IDE's windows (e.g. Projects (Ctrl-1), Files (Ctrl-2), Favorites 
            (Ctrl-3) windows).</p>
        
        <p>When working with sources in the IDE, there are various UI components at your
            disposal, which aid in both viewing and operating version control commands:</p>

            <p>When you open a versioned file in the IDE's Source Editor, you can view real-time
                changes occurring to your file as you modify it against your previously checked-out
                base version from the repository. As you work, the IDE uses color encoding in the 
                Source Editor's margins to convey the following information:</p>
            
            <table class="cell">
                <tr>
                    <td class="align-right cell"><strong>Blue</strong> 
                        ( <span style="background-color:#b8cfe5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> )</td>
                    <td>Indicates lines that have been changed since the earlier revision.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="align-right cell"><strong>Green</strong> 
                        ( <span style="background-color:#b4ffb4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> )</td>
                    <td>Indicates lines that have been added since the earlier revision.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="align-right cell"><strong>Red</strong> 
                        ( <span style="background-color:#ffa0b4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> )</td>
                    <td>Indicates lines that have been removed since the earlier revision.</td>                
                </tr>
            </table>                
            
            <br>
            <p>The Source Editor's left margin shows changes occurring on a line-by-line basis.
                When you modify a given line, changes are immediately shown in the left margin.</p>
                
            <p>You can click on a color grouping in the margin to call versioning commands. For
                example, the screen capture below left shows widgets available to you when clicking 
                a red icon, indicating that lines have been removed from your local copy.</p>
                
            <p>The Source Editor's right margin provides you with an overview that displays 
                changes made to your file as a whole, from top to bottom. Color encoding is
                generated immediately when you make changes to your file.</p>
                
            <p>Note that you can click on a specific point within the margin to bring your 
                inline cursor immediately to that location in the file. To view the number of
                lines affected, hover your mouse over the colored icons in the right margin:</p>

            <h3>Viewing File Status Information</h3>            
             
            <p>When you are working in the Projects (Ctrl-1), Files (Ctrl-2), Favorites 
                (Ctrl-3), or Versioning windows, the IDE provides several visual features
                that aid in viewing status information about your files. In the example
                below, notice how the badge (e.g. 
                <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/ide/cvs/blue-badge.png"
                alt="blue badge">), color of the file name, and adjacent status
                label, all coincide with each other to provide you with a simple but
                effective way to keep track of versioning information on your files:</p>
            
                <p class="align-center">

            <p>Badges, color coding, file status labels, and perhaps most importantly,
                the Versioning window all contribute to your ability to effectively 
                view and manage and versioning information in the IDE.</p>

                <h4>File Status Labels</h4>
                
                <p>File status labels provide a textual indication of the status of versioned 
                    files in the IDE's windows. By default, the IDE displays status (new, modified, 
                    ignored, etc.) and tag information in gray text to the right of files, as 
                    they are listed in windows. You can, however, modify this format to suit 
                    your own needs. For example, if you want to add revision numbers to status 
                    labels, do the following:</p>
                    
                <ol>
                    <li>Choose Tools &gt; Options (NetBeans &gt; Preferences on Mac) from the main
                        menu. The Options window opens.</li>
                    <li>Select the Miscellaneous button along the top of the window, then click 
                        the Versioning tab beneath it. Make sure CVS is selected beneath Versioning 
                        Systems in the left panel:
                        
                        <p class="align-center">

                    <li>Click the Add Variable button to the right of the Status Label Format 
                        text field. In the Add Variable dialog that displays, select the 
                        <code>{revision}</code> variable, then click OK. The revision variable
                        is added to the status label Format text field.</li>
                    <li>To reformat status labels so that only status and revision display to 
                        the right of files, rearrange the contents of the status label Format 
                        text field to the following:
                        
                        <pre class="examplecode">[{status}; {revision}]</pre>
               
                        Click OK. Status labels now list file status and revision numbers 
                        (where applicable):

                <h4>The Versioning Window</h4>
                    
                <p>The CVS Versioning window provides you with a real-time list of all 
                    of the changes made to files within a selected folder of your local working 
                    copy. It opens by default in the bottom panel of the IDE, listing added, 
                    deleted or modified files.</p>
                
                <p>To open the Versioning window, select a versioned file or folder (e.g. from 
                    the Projects, Files, or Favorites window) and either choose CVS &gt; 
                    Show Changes from the right-click menu, or choose Versioning &gt; Show Changes 
                    from the main menu. The following window appears in the bottom of the IDE:</p>
                
                   <p class="align-center">
                        <a href="../../../images_www/articles/73/ide/cvs/cvs-versioning-window.png" rel="lytebox"

                            class="b-none margin-around" alt="versioning window displaying locally modified files"></a></p>
    
                <p>By default, the Versioning window displays a list of all modified files within 
                    the selected package or folder. Using the buttons in the toolbar, you can 
                    choose to display all changes or limit the list of displayed files to either 
                    locally or remotely modified files. You can also click the column headings 
                    above the listed files to sort the files by name, status or location.</p>

                <p>The Versioning window toolbar also includes buttons that enable you to invoke 
                    the most common CVS tasks on all files displayed in the list. The 
                    following table lists the CVS commands available in the toolbar of the 
                    Versioning window:</p>

            <h3>Comparing File Revisions</h3>
            
            <p>Comparing file revisions is a common task when working with versioned
                projects. The IDE enables you to compare revisions by using the Diff
                command, which is available from the right-click menu of a selected 
                item (CVS &gt; Diff), as well as from the Versioning window.
                In the Versioning window, you can perform diffs by either double-clicking
                a listed file, otherwise you can click the Diff All icon (<img alt="diff all icon" 
                src="../../../images_www/articles/73/ide/cvs/diff.png">) located in
                the toolbar at the top.</p>
            
            <p>When you perform a diff, a graphical Diff Viewer opens for the selected 
                file(s) and revisions in the IDE's main window. The Diff Viewer displays
                two copies in side-by-side panels. The more current copy appears on the 
                right side, so if you are comparing a repository revision against your 
                working copy, the working copy displays in the right panel:</p>

               <p class="align-center">
                <a href="../../../images_www/articles/73/ide/cvs/diff-viewer.png" rel="lytebox"
                    title="CVS Diff Viewer">
                    <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/ide/cvs/diff-viewer-small.png"
                    class="b-all margin-around" alt="CVS Diff Viewer"></a></p>
              
            <p>The Diff Viewer makes use of the same <a href="#viewingChanges">color encoding</a> 
                used elsewhere to display version control changes. In the screen capture 
                displayed above, the green block indicates content that has been added to
                the more current revision. The red block indicates that content from the 
                earlier revision has been removed from the later.  Blue indicates that 
                changes have occurred within the highlighted line(s).</p>
              
            <p>Also, when performing a diff on a group of files, such as on a project,
                package, or folder, or when clicking Diff All
                (<img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/ide/cvs/diff.png"
                alt="diff all icon">), you can switch between diffs by clicking files
                listed in the upper region of the Diff Viewer.</p>
            
            <p>The Diff Viewer also provides you with the following functionality:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#makeChanges">Make Changes to your Local Working Copy</a></li>
                <li><a href="#navigateDifferences">Navigate Among Differences</a></li>

                <h4>Make Changes to your Local Working Copy</h4>

                <p>If you are performing a diff on your local working copy, the IDE enables you 
                    to make changes directly from within the Diff Viewer. To do so, you can either 
                    place your cursor within the right pane of the Diff Viewer and modify your 
                    file accordingly, otherwise make use of the inline icons that display adjacent 
                    to each highlighted change:</p>

                    using the arrow icons displayed in the toolbar. The arrow icons enable you

            <h3>Merging File Revisions</h3>

            <p>NetBeans IDE enables you to merge changes made on different branches 
                of the repository with your local working copy. Using the CVS Merge 
                dialog, you need only specify criteria indicating which repository 
                sources you want merged with your working copy.</p>

            <p>The following simple use-case demonstrates how you can apply the Merge 
                dialog to merge a complete branch into the trunk's head:</p>
                
            <br>

                        There is a request to begin development of a new feature for

                        of the project's trunk. After all necessary work is done and
                        the code is stable enough in the branch, you integrate the new
                        feature into the trunk.

                    Click the Branch button. A new branch is created in the repository, 
                    and the IDE switches your target repository location to the new branch. 
                    In the Projects window, the new branch name displays in grey text

            <p><strong class="notes">Note: </strong>After merging file changes from a

        <h2>Committing Sources to a Repository</h2>
         
        <p>After making changes to sources, you commit them to the repository. It is 
            generally a good idea to update any copies you have against the repository 
            prior to performing a commit in order to ensure that conflicts do not arise. 
            Conflicts can occur however, and should be thought of as a natural event 
            when numerous developers are working on a project simultaneously. The IDE 
            provides flexible support that enables you to perform all of these functions. 
            It also provides a Conflict Resolver which allows you to safely deal with any 
            conflicts as they occur.</p>

            <a name="updating"></a>
            <h3>Updating Local Copies</h3>
            
            <p>You can perform updates by choosing CVS &gt; Update from the 
                right-click menu of any versioned item in the Projects, Files, or 
                Favorites windows.  When working directly from the Versioning window, 
                you need only right-click a listed file and choose Update.</p>
                
            <p>To perform an update on sources that you have modified, you can click 
                the Update All icon (<img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/ide/cvs/update.png"
                alt="update all icon">), which displays in the toolbars located
                at the top of both the <a href="#versioning">Versioning Window</a>, 
                as well as the <a href="#comparing">Diff Viewer</a>. Any changes that
                may have occurred in the repository are displayed in the Versioning
                Output window.</p>
    
            <a name="resolving"></a>
            <h3>Resolving Conflicts</h3>
            
            <p>When you perform an update or a commit, the IDE's CVS support compares 
                your files with repository sources to make sure that other changes have 
                not already occurred in the same locations. When your previous checkout 
                (or update) no longer matches the repository <em>HEAD</em> (i.e., most 
                current revision), <em>and</em> the changes that you applied to your 
                local working copy coincide with areas in the HEAD that have also changed, 
                your update or commit results in a <em>conflict</em>.</p>
                
            <p>As indicated in <a href="#badges">Badges and Color Coding</a>, conflicts 
                are displayed in the IDE with red text and are accompanied by a red badge 
                (<img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/ide/cvs/red-badge.png"
                alt="red badge">) when viewed in the Projects, Files, or Favorites windows.
                When working in the Versioning window, conflicts are also indicated
                by a file's status:</p>
                
                <p class="align-center">
                <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/ide/cvs/cvs-conflict-versioning-win.png"
                    class="b-right margin-around" alt="file conflict displayed in Versioning window"></p>
               
            <p>Any conflicts that arise must be resolved before you commit files to the 
                repository. You can resolve conflicts in the IDE using the Merge Conflicts 
                Resolver. The Merge Conflicts Resolver provides an intuitive interface 
                that enables you to address individual conflicts sequentially while viewing 
                merged output as you make changes. You can access the Merge Conflicts 
                Resolver on a file that is in conflict by right-clicking that file and
                choosing CVS &gt; Resolve Conflicts.</p>
      
            <p>The Merge Conflicts Resolver displays the two conflicting revisions 
                side-by-side in the top pane, with the conflicting areas highlighted.
                The lower pane depicts the file as it appears while merges for individual
                conflicts between the two revisions occur:</p>
                
                <p class="align-center">
                <a href="../../../images_www/articles/73/ide/cvs/conflict-resolver.png" rel="lytebox"

                    alt="Conflict Resolver displaying a conflicted file"></a></p>
               
                <p>You resolve a conflict by accepting one of the two revisions displayed
                in the top pane. Click the Accept button of the revision you want to 
                accept. The IDE merges the accepted revision with the source file, and 
                you can immediately see the results of the merge in the bottom pane of 
                the Merge Conflicts Resolver. Once all conflicts are resolved, click OK 
                to exit the Merge Conflicts Resolver and save the modified file. The 
                conflict badge is removed and you can now commit the modified file to 
                the repository.</p>
            
            <a name="performing"></a>
            <h3>Performing the Commit</h3>
            
            <p>After editing source files, performing an update and resolving any conflicts,
                you commit files from your local working copy to the repository. The IDE
                enables you to call the commit command in the following ways:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>From the Projects, Files or Favorites windows, right-click new or 
                    modified items and choose CVS &gt; Commit.</li>
                <li>From the Versioning window or Diff Viewer, click the Commit All 
                    (<img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/ide/cvs/commit.png"
                    alt="commit all icon">) button located in the toolbar.</li>
            </ul>
                
            <p>The Commit dialog opens, displaying files that are about to be committed 
                to the repository:</p>
                
                <p class="align-center">
                <a href="../../../images_www/articles/73/ide/cvs/cvs-commit-dialog.png" rel="lytebox"
                    title="Commit dialog displaying files about to be committed">
                    <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/ide/cvs/cvs-commit-dialog-small.png" class="b-none margin-around"
                    alt="Commit dialog displaying files about to be committed"></a></p>
                
            <p>The Commit dialog lists:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>all locally modified files</li>
                <li>all files that have been deleted locally</li>                
                <li>all new files (i.e., files that do not yet exist in the repository)</li>
                <li>all files that you have renamed. CVS handles renamed files by
                    deleting the original file, and creating a duplicate using the new 
                    name.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>From the Commit dialog, it is possible to specify whether to exclude 
                individual files from the commit. To do so, click the Commit Action column
                of a selected file and choose Exclude from Commit from the drop-down
                list.</p>
                
            <p>When new binary files are included, such as image files, they are automatically 
                detected as binary files. You can specify the MIME type of a file by choosing 
                Add as Binary or Add as Text from the drop-down list within the Commit Action
                column.</p>
            
            <p>To perform the commit:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Type in a commit message in the Commit Message text area. Alternatively,
                    click the Recent Messages ( <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/ide/cvs/recent-msgs.png"
                    alt="recent messages icon"> ) icon located in the upper right corner to
                    view and select from a list of messages that you have previously used.</li>
                <li>After specifying actions for individual files, click Commit. The IDE 
                    executes the commit and sends your local changes to the repository.
                    The IDE's status bar, located in the bottom right of the interface, 
                    displays as the commit action takes place. Upon a successful commit,
                    versioning badges disappear in the Projects, Files and Favorites windows, 
                    and the color encoding of committed files returns to black.</li>
            </ol>
