        <h1>Using Subversion Support in NetBeans IDE</h1>
        
        <p>NetBeans IDE  provides tight integration with Subversion client versions 1.6.x and
            higher. The IDE's Subversion support is designed to help streamline the development
            process for groups working from a shared repository, enabling you to perform versioning
            tasks directly from your project system within the IDE.</p>
        
        <p>This document demonstrates how to perform basic versioning tasks in the IDE by 
            guiding you through the standard workflow when using versioning software.</p>

        <p>Please note that NetBeans Subversion support <em>does not</em> work when used 
            with Cygwin.</p>
            
        <p><a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> is a popular open source 
            version control system that is becoming the next-generation replacement for CVS. 
            It provides various improved features, for example:</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li>Full version history is provided for renamed, moved or removed files.</li>
            <li>Commit operations are atomic, meaning that a collection of modifications 
                either enter the repository completely or, in the event of connection failure, 
                not at all.</li>
            <li>Versioning of project metadata is provided.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Setting up Subversion</h2>
        
        <p>Before you can take advantage of the IDE's Subversion support, you need to 
            have Subversion client software installed on your computer. The IDE's Subversion 
            support works by interacting with the Subversion client to carry out versioning 
            commands. Depending on your system, and whether you install the Subversion 
            client to a non-default location, you may also need to register the path to the 
            Subversion executable in the IDE. Finally, you need to make sure that you have a
            Subversion repository to connect to.</p>

        </ul>
            
        <div class="indent">
            <a name="getting"></a>
            <h3>Getting the Software</h3>
        
            <p>Make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>NetBeans IDE  (<a href="https://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html">download</a>)</li>
                <li>Java SE Development Kit (<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">download</a>)</li>                
                <li>Subversion client software (<a href="http://www.open.collab.net/downloads/netbeans/">download</a>)</li>
               
            </ul>
        
            
        
        <a name="specifying"></a>
            <h3>Specifying the Path to the Subversion Executable</h3>
                
            <p>NetBeans IDE automatically tries to identify the location of the Subversion
                executable file by using the <code>$PATH</code> system variable on your computer.
                Depending on your platform however, or whether you installed the Subversion 
                client to a different location, it may be necessary to specify the path to 
                the executable file explicitly.</p>
           
            
<p>By default, the Subversion executable file is installed in the <code>/usr/bin</code>
                or <code>/usr/local/bin/</code> folder on UNIX and  OS X machines, and in
                <code>C:\Program Files\Subversion\bin\</code> (or <code>C:\Program Files\CollabNet
                Subversion\bin\</code>) for Windows.</p>

            <p class="tips">On *nix-based machines, you can verify the location of the Subversion
                executable by typing <code>which svn</code> into a terminal window. On Windows
                machines, you can perform a system-wide search for <code>svn.exe</code>.</p>

            <p>To set the path to the Subversion executable file in the IDE:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Choose Tools &gt; Options (NetBeans &gt; Preferences on OS X) from the main
                    menu. The Options dialog opens.</li>
                <li>Select the Miscellaneous icon along the top of the dialog, then click the 
                    Versioning tab. In the left pane under Versioning Systems, select Subversion.
                    User-defined options for Subversion display in the main window of the dialog:
                    
                    <p class="align-center"><a name="svnOptions"></a>
                    <a href="../../../images_www/articles/73/ide/subversion/svn-options.png" rel="lytebox"
                       title="Subversion Options dialog featuring user-defined options">
                       <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/ide/subversion/svn-options-small.png" class="margin-around"
                       alt="Subversion Options dialog featuring user-defined options"></a></p></li>                    
                    
                <li>In the Specify the SVN Home Folder text field, either type in the path to the 
                    executable file or click Browse to navigate to it on your system. Note that 
                    you need not <em>include</em> the Subversion executable file in the path.</li>
                <li>Click OK, then restart the IDE to allow changes to take effect.</li>
            </ol>

            <a name="ensuring"></a>
            <h3>Ensuring you have a Repository to Connect to</h3>

            <p>Before invoking Subversion actions from the IDE, make sure you have access to a Subversion
                repository. The IDE <em>does not</em> provide support for creating Subversion repositories
                as this is not a frequently used action (In a production environment a repository is only
                created once, after the design of the repository layout has been determined.) and moreover
                it requires administrative commands.</p>

            <p>If you would like to experiment with the IDE's support using a local repository,
                you can create one using the <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch09s02.html">svnadmin 
          tool</a>, which is included in the Subversion client software.</p>

            <p>To create a Subversion repository on your computer, use <code>svnadmin create</code>. From a command-line
                prompt, type in the following:</p>

            <pre class="examplecode">svnadmin create /path/to/your/repository</pre>

            <p>For more information, see: <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch05s02.html">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch05s02.html</a>.</p>

        <a name="synchronizing"></a>
        <h2>Synchronizing Local Files with a Repository</h2>
        
        <p>When using a version control system, you work by synchronizing local files
            with a repository, making changes to your local copy, then committing them to 
            the repository. The following list describes various ways you can synchronize 
            a project in NetBeans IDE, depending on your specific situation:</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#opening">Opening a Subversion Project in the IDE</a> </li>
            <li><a href="#checking">Checking out Files from a Repository</a></li>
            <li><a href="#importing">Importing Files into a Repository</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="indent">
            <a name="opening"></a>
            <h3>Opening a Subversion Project in the IDE</h3>

            <p>If you already have a Subversion versioned project which you have been working 
                with outside of the IDE, you can open it in the IDE and versioning features 
                will automatically become available to you. The IDE scans your open projects 
                and if they contain <code>.svn</code> directories, file status and context-sensitive
                support automatically becomes active for Subversion versioned projects.</p> 

            <a name="checking"></a>
            <h3>Checking out Files from a Repository</h3>

            <p>If you want to connect to a remote repository from the IDE, then check out 
                files and immediately begin working with them, do the following:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>In NetBeans IDE, choose Team &gt; Subversion &gt; Checkout from
                    the main menu. The Checkout wizard opens.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong class="notes">Note: </strong>The IDE's drop-down menus are context-sensitive, 
                    i.e. the available options depend on the item currently selected. 
                    Therefore, if you are already working within a Subversion project,
                    you can choose Versioning &gt; Checkout from the main menu.</li>
                <li>In the first panel of the wizard, enter a URL that contains the connection 
                    protocol and location of the repository you want to connect to. 
                    
                    <br><br>
                    <a name="protocolTypes"></a>
                    The IDE supports the following protocol types:
                    
                    <br><br>

                    <br>
                    Depending on the protocol you are using, you may need to enter other 
                    information, such as username and password (e.g. for <code>http://</code>,
                    <code>https://</code>, or <code>svn://</code>), or in the case of <code>svn+ssh://</code>,
                    you must supply the command to establish the external tunnel.

                    to view all folders currently maintained in the repository. From the Browse 
                    Repository Folders dialog that appears, select any of the listed folders 
                    and click OK. The selected folder is then added to the Repository Folder(s)

                    local working directory. You can also view files as they are being checked 
                    out from the Output window (Ctrl-4 on Windows/Cmd-4 on OS X).

            <h3>Importing Files into a Repository</h3>        

            <p>Alternately, you can import a project you have been working on in the IDE to
                a remote repository, then continue to work on it in the IDE after it has 
                become synchronized.</p>

            <p><strong class="notes">Note: </strong>While you are actually <em>exporting</em> files 
                from your system, the term 'import' is used in version control systems to 
                signify that files are being <em>imported into</em> a repository.</p>
            
            <p>To import a project to a repository:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>From the Projects window (Ctrl-1 on Windows/Cmd-1 on OS X), select an unversioned project and 
                    choose Versioning &gt; Import into Subversion Repository from the 
                    node's right-click menu. The Subversion Import wizard opens.</li>
                <li>In the Subversion Repository panel of the Import wizard, specify the
                    <a href="#protocolTypes">protocol</a> and location of the Subversion 
                    repository as defined by the Subversion URL. Depending on your selection, 
                    you may need to specify further settings, such as repository username 
                    and password, or, in the case of <code>svn+ssh://</code>, you must specify
                    the tunnel command to establish the external tunnel. See the <a 
                    href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/wiki/view/NetBeansUserFAQ#section-NetBeansUserFAQ-VersionControlSystems">Subversion
                    User FAQ</a> for further details. Click Next.</li>
                <li>In the Repository Folder panel, specify the repository folder in which you 
                    want to place the project in the repository. A folder containing the name
                    of your project is suggested for you in the Repository Folder text field 
                    by default.</li>
                <li>In the text area beneath Specify the Message, enter a description of the 
                    project you are importing into the repository.</li>
                <li>Click Finish to initiate the import, or optionally, click Next to continue
                    to a third panel that enables you to preview all files that are prepared 
                    for import. From this panel, you can choose to exclude individual files
                    from the import (as shown below), or identify the MIME types of files before 
                    importing.

                    Upon clicking Finish, the IDE uploads the project files to the repository 
                    and the Output window opens to display the progress.</li>

        <h2>Editing Sources</h2>
        
        <p>Once you have a Subversion versioned project opened in the IDE, you can begin 
            making changes to sources. As with any project opened in NetBeans IDE, you can 
            open files in the Source Editor by double-clicking on their nodes, as they
            appear in the IDE's windows (for example, Projects (Ctrl-1 on Windows/Cmd-1 on OS X), Files (Ctrl-2 on Windows/Cmd-2 on OS X), Favorites 
            (Ctrl-3 on Windows/Cmd-3 on OS X)).</p>
        
        <p>When working with sources in the IDE, there are various UI components at your
            disposal, which aid in both viewing and operating version control commands:</p> 
   
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#viewingChanges">Viewing Changes in the Source Editor</a></li>
            <li><a href="#viewingFileStatus">Viewing File Status Information</a></li>

            <h3>Viewing Changes in the Source Editor</h3>
            
            <p>When you open a versioned file in the IDE's Source Editor, you can view real-time
                changes occurring to your file as you modify it against your previously checked-out
                base version from the repository. As you work, the IDE uses color encoding in the 
                Source Editor's margins to convey the following information:</p>
            
            <table class="cell">
                <tr>
                    <td class="align-right cell"><strong>Blue</strong> 
                        ( <span style="background-color:#b8cfe5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> )</td>
                    <td>Indicates lines that have been changed since the earlier revision.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="align-right cell"><strong>Green</strong> 
                        ( <span style="background-color:#b4ffb4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> )</td>
                    <td>Indicates lines that have been added since the earlier revision.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="align-right cell"><strong>Red</strong> 
                        ( <span style="background-color:#ffa0b4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> )</td>
                    <td>Indicates lines that have been removed since the earlier revision.</td>                
                </tr>
            </table>                
            
            <br>
            <p>The Source Editor's left margin shows changes occurring on a line-by-line basis.
                When you modify a given line, changes are immediately shown in the left margin.</p>
                
            <p>You can click on a color grouping in the margin to call versioning commands. For
                example, the screen capture below left shows widgets available to you when clicking 
                a red icon, indicating that lines have been removed from your local copy.</p>
                
            <p>The Source Editor's right margin provides you with an overview that displays 
                changes made to your file as a whole, from top to bottom. Color encoding is
                generated immediately when you make changes to your file.</p>
                
            <p>Note that you can click on a specific point within the margin to bring your 
                inline cursor immediately to that location in the file. To view the number of
                lines affected, hover your mouse over the colored icons in the right margin:</p>

            <h3>Viewing File Status Information</h3>            
             
            <p>When you are working in the Projects (Ctrl-1 on Windows/Cmd-1 on OS X), Files (Ctrl-2 on Windows/Cmd-2 on OS X), Favorites 
                (Ctrl-3 on Windows/Cmd-3 on OS X), or Versioning windows, the IDE provides several visual features
                that aid in viewing status information about your files. In the example
                below, notice how the badge (e.g. 
                <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/ide/subversion/blue-badge.png"
                alt="Blue badge">), color of the file name, and adjacent status
                label, all coincide with each other to provide you with a simple but
                effective way to keep track of versioning information on your files:
            
                <br>

            <p>Badges, color coding, file status labels, and perhaps most importantly,
                the Versioning window all contribute to your ability to effectively 
                view and manage and versioning information in the IDE.</p>

                <h4>File Status Labels</h4>
                
                <p>File status labels provide a textual indication of the status of versioned 
                    files in the IDE's windows. By default, the IDE displays status (new, modified, 
                    ignored, etc.) and folder information in gray text to the right of files, as 
                    they are listed in windows. You can, however, modify this format to suit 
                    your own needs. For example, if you want to add revision numbers to status 
                    labels, do the following:</p>
                    
                <ol>
                    <li>Choose Tools &gt; Options (NetBeans &gt; Preferences on OS X) from the
                        main menu. The Options window opens.</li>
                    <li>Select the Miscellaneous button along the top of the window, then click 
                        the Versioning tab beneath it. Make sure Subversion is selected beneath 
                        Versioning Systems in the left panel. (See the above <a href="#svnOptions">screen 
                        capture</a> for reference.)</li>
                    <li>Click the Add Variable button to the right of the status label Format 
                        text field. In the Add Variable dialog that displays, select the 
                        <code>{revision}</code> variable, then click OK. The revision variable
                        is added to the status label Format text field.</li>
                    <li>To reformat status labels so that only status and revision display to 
                        the right of files, rearrange the contents of the Status Label Format 
                        text field to the following:
                        
                        <pre class="examplecode">[{status}; {revision}]</pre>
               
                        Click OK. Status labels now list file status and revision numbers 
                        (where applicable):

                <p>The Subversion Versioning window provides you with a real-time list of all 
                    of the changes made to files within a selected folder of your local working 
                    copy. It opens by default in the bottom panel of the IDE, listing added, 
                    deleted or modified files.</p>
                
                <p>To open the Versioning window, select a versioned file or folder (e.g. from 
                    the Projects, Files, or Favorites window) and either choose Subversion &gt; 
                    Show Changes from the right-click menu, or choose Team &gt; Show Changes 
                    from the main menu. The following window appears in the bottom of the IDE:</p>

                <p>By default, the Versioning window displays a list of all modified files within 
                    the selected package or folder. Using the buttons in the toolbar, you can 
                    choose to display all changes or limit the list of displayed files to either 
                    locally or remotely modified files. You can also click the column headings 
                    above the listed files to sort the files by name, status or location.</p>
					<p class="notes"><b>Notes:</b></p>
					<ul><li> To get notified of when a source file

            <h3>Comparing File Revisions</h3>
            
            <p>Comparing file revisions is a common task when working with versioned
                projects. The IDE enables you to compare revisions by using the Diff
                command, which is available from the right-click menu of a selected 
                item (Subversion &gt; Diff), as well as from the Versioning window.
                In the Versioning window, you can perform diffs by either double-clicking

                toolbar at the top.</p>
            
            <p>When you perform a diff, a graphical Diff Viewer opens for the selected 
                file(s) and revisions in the IDE's main window. The Diff Viewer displays
                two copies in side-by-side panels. The more current copy appears on the 
                right side, so if you are comparing a repository revision against your 
                working copy, the working copy displays in the right panel:</p>

                displayed above, the green block indicates content that has been added to
                the more current revision. The red block indicates that content from the

                (<img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/ide/subversion/diff.png"

            <h3>Merging File Revisions</h3>

            <p>NetBeans IDE enables you to merge changes between repository revisions and
                your local working copy. You can specify a range of revisions to merge. You 
                can even merge a range of revisions from two separate repository folders.</p>
                
            <p>The following scenario describes a common use-case: You have checked out the 
                trunk version on a folder named <code>JavaApp</code>, and now want to merge your
                copy with a branch. For demonstrative purposes, your repository layout 
                contains a <code>branches</code> folder used to contain all branched files:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>In the Projects, Files, or Favorites window, right-click the files or 
                    folders on which you want to perform the merge operation and choose 
                    Subversion &gt; Merge Changes. The Merge dialog displays.</li>
                <li>In the Merge From drop-down list, select One Repository Folder Since 
                    Its Origin. You are porting all changes made on a single branch from 
                    the time it was created.</li>
                <li>In the Repository Folder text field, enter the path to the folder from 
                    which you want to port changes (<code>branches/JavaApp</code>). Leave the
                    Ending Revision field empty to indicate that you want to include all
                    revisions up to the <em>HEAD</em> (i.e. current state).
                    
                     <p class="align-center">
                    <a href="../../../images_www/articles/73/ide/subversion/svn-merge.png" rel="lytebox"

                        class="margin-around b-none" alt="Subversion Merge dialog"></a></p></li>

                <li>Click Merge. The IDE incorporates any differences found between the 
                    branch revisions and your local copy of the file. If merge conflicts 
                    occur, the file's status is updated to <a href="#resolving">Merge 
                    Conflict</a> to indicate this.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong class="notes">Note: </strong>After merging revisions to your local working
                copy, you must still commit changes using the Commit command in order for them

        <h2>Committing Sources to a Repository</h2>
         
        <p>After making changes to sources, you commit them to the repository. It is 
            generally a good idea to update any copies you have against the repository 
            prior to performing a commit in order to ensure that conflicts do not arise. 
            Conflicts can occur however, and should be thought of as a natural event 
            when numerous developers are working on a project simultaneously. The IDE 
            provides flexible support that enables you to perform all of these functions. 
            It also provides a Conflict Resolver which allows you to safely deal with any 
            conflicts as they occur.</p>

            <h3>Updating Local Copies</h3>
            
            <p>You can perform updates by choosing Subversion &gt; Update from the 
                right-click menu of any versioned item in the Projects, Files, or 
                Favorites windows.  When working directly from the Versioning window, 
                you need only right-click a listed file and choose Update.</p>
                
            <p>To perform an update on all source files, you can click 
                the Update All icon (<img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/ide/subversion/update.png"
                alt="Update all icon">), which displays in the toolbars located

                as well as the <a href="#comparing">Diff Viewer</a>. Any changes that
                may have occurred in the repository are displayed in the Versioning

            <a name="resolving"></a>
            <h3>Resolving Conflicts</h3>
            
            <p>When you perform an update or a commit, the IDE's Subversion support 
                compares your files with repository sources to make sure that other 
                changes have not already occurred in the same locations. When your 
                previous checkout (or update) no longer matches the repository <em>HEAD</em>
                (i.e. most current revision), <em>and</em> the changes that you applied 
                to your local working copy coincide with areas in the HEAD that 
                have also changed, your update or commit results in a <em>conflict</em>.</p>
                
            <p>As indicated in <a href="#badges">Badges and Color Coding</a>, conflicts 
                are displayed in the IDE with red text and are accompanied by a red badge 
                (<img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/ide/subversion/red-badge.png"
                alt="Red badge">) when viewed in the Projects, Files, or Favorites windows.
                When working in the Versioning window, conflicts are also indicated
                by a file's status:</p>
                
                <p class="align-center">

                    class="b-right margin-around" alt="File conflict displayed in Versioning window"></p>
               
            <p>Any conflicts that arise must be resolved before you commit files to the 
                repository. You can resolve conflicts in the IDE using the Merge Conflicts 
                Resolver. The Merge Conflicts Resolver provides an intuitive interface 
                that enables you to address individual conflicts sequentially while viewing 
                merged output as you make changes. You can access the Merge Conflicts 
                Resolver on a file that is in conflict by right-clicking that file and
                choosing Subversion &gt; Resolve Conflicts.</p>
      
            <p>The Merge Conflicts Resolver displays the two conflicting revisions 
                side-by-side in the top pane, with the conflicting areas highlighted.
                The lower pane depicts the file as it appears while merges for individual
                conflicts between the two revisions occur:</p>

                <p>
                You resolve a conflict by accepting one of the two revisions displayed
                in the top pane. Click the Accept button of the revision you want to 
                accept. The IDE merges the accepted revision with the source file, and 
                you can immediately see the results of the merge in the bottom pane of 
                the Merge Conflicts Resolver. Once all conflicts are resolved, click OK 
                to exit the Merge Conflicts Resolver and save the modified file. The 
                conflict badge is removed and you can now commit the modified file to 
                the repository.</p>

            <h3>Performing the Commit</h3>
            
            <p>After editing source files, performing an update and resolving any conflicts,
                you commit files from your local working copy to the repository. The IDE
                enables you to call the commit command in the following ways:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>From the Projects, Files or Favorites windows, right-click new or 
                    modified items and choose Subversion &gt; Commit.</li>
                <li>From the Versioning window or Diff Viewer, click the Commit All

            </ul>
                
            <p>The Commit dialog opens, displaying files that are about to be committed

            <p>The Commit dialog lists:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>all locally modified files</li>

                <li>all files that you have renamed. Subversion handles renamed files by
                    deleting the original file, and creating a duplicate using the new 
                    name.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>From the Commit dialog, it is possible to specify whether to exclude 
                individual files from the commit. To do so, click the Commit Action column
                of a selected file and choose Exclude from Commit from the drop-down
                list. Similarly, when new files are included, you can specify the MIME
                type by choosing Add as Binary or Add as Text from the drop-down list.</p>
            
            <p>To perform the commit:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Type in a commit message in the Commit Message text area. Alternatively,
                    click the Recent Messages ( <img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/ide/subversion/recent-msgs.png"
                    alt="Recent messages icon"> ) icon located in the upper right corner to
                    view and select from a list of messages that you have previously used.</li>
                <li>After specifying actions for individual files, click Commit. The IDE 
                    executes the commit and sends your local changes to the repository.
                    The IDE's status bar, located in the bottom right of the interface, 
                    displays as the commit action takes place. Upon a successful commit,
                    versioning badges disappear in the Projects, Files and Favorites windows, 
                    and the color encoding of committed files returns to black.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>This concludes the guided tour of Subversion for NetBeans IDE 6.x and higher. This 
            document demonstrated how to perform basic versioning tasks in the IDE by 
            guiding you through the standard workflow when using the IDE's Subversion 
            support. It has shown how to set up a versioned project and perform basic 
            tasks on versioned files while introducing you to some of the new Subversion 
            features included in the IDE.</p>
