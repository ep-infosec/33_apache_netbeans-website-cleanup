<h1>Introduction to the Grails Web Framework</h1>
<p>
    This document gets you started with <a href="http://www.grails.org">Grails</a> in 
    NetBeans IDE. From the Grails site: "Grails aims to bring the 'coding by convention'
    paradigm to Groovy. 
    It's an open-source web application framework that leverages the Groovy 
    language and complements Java Web development. You can use Grails as a standalone
    development environment that hides all configuration details or integrate your
    Java business logic. Grails aims to make development as simple as possible 
    and hence should appeal to a wide range of developers not just those from
    the Java community."

    <div class="indent">
        <ul>
            <li>You need to use JDK 7 as the Java Platform. Grails currently does not run on JDK 8.</li>
            <li>You need to activate the Groovy plugin to develop Grails applications in the IDE.</li>
            <li>Open the Options window of the IDE and set the location of Grails in the Groovy tab in the Miscellaneous category.
            <p>If you want to use Groovy, also set the location of Groovy there.</p></li>
            <li>Read the official <a href="http://grails.org/Quick%20Start" class="pageLink">Grails Quick Start</a>, which presents the scenario that we will reproduce in the sections that follow.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>


<a name="application"></a>
<h2>Creating the Application</h2>

<p>In this section, we run the "grails create-app" command from the IDE,
 by using the "Grails Application" project template to create a new
 Grails application.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Install Grails on your local system and confirm that it is configured correctly.
        <p>You can confirm it is working correctly by running Grails from the command line (i.e., type "grails" at the command prompt).</p></li>
<li>Choose File &gt; New Project (Ctrl-Shift-N) and then select "Grails Application" from
    the "Groovy" category. Click Next.</li>
<li>In Project Name, type "BookDemo"; in Project Location, select the folder
    where the application will be created. Click Finish.</li>
</ol>

<p>The IDE runs the "grails create-app" command, showing the output in the
    Output window. The Projects window should show you this:</p>

<img src="../../../images_www/articles/72/web/grails/grails-65-4.png" border="0" alt="">
<p>Expand the folders and have a look at the source structure created
 by the IDE via the Grails scripts. 
 Also look at the generated files and notice that many of them have default values filled in.</p>

 <a name="domain"></a>
<h2>Creating the Domain Class</h2>
<p>In this section, we use the IDE to run the "grails create-domain-class" script.</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on the Domain Classes node and choose New &gt; Grails Domain Class.
<li>Name the domain class "Book" and click Finish. The "Book.groovy" domain is created
 in the Domain Classes node.
<li>Open the Book class and then fill in two Strings, "title" and "author". You should now see this:<br>
<img border="1" src="../../../images_www/articles/72/web/grails/grails-65-8.png"  alt="screenshot of book class in source editor"><br></li>
<li>Create some initial values in the Bootstrap.groovy class, which is within the
 Configuration node. The code added to the class is shown in bold below:
<pre class="examplecode">class BootStrap {

     def init = { servletContext ->
         <b>new Book(author:"Stephen King",title:"The Shining").save()
         new Book(author:"James Patterson",title:"Along Came a Spider").save()</b>
     }
     
     def destroy = {
     }
     
}</pre>
 <p class="notes"><strong>Note.</strong> Add an import for <tt>bookdemo.Book</tt>
     if you see a warning in the left margin of the source editor. </p>
</li>
</ol>

<a name="controller"></a>
<h2>Creating the Controller</h2>

<p>In this section, we use the "grails create-controller" script to create
    a controller for our domain class:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Right-click the Controllers node and choose New &gt; Grails Controller.</li>
<li>Type "Book" in Class Name and notice that you are shown that the generated class will be called "BookController":<br>
  <img src="../../../images_www/articles/72/web/grails/grails-65-11.png" class="margin-around b-all" alt="screenshot of New Controller dialog box">
  <p>Click Finish. The controller is generated.</p></li>
<li>Comment out the one line generated within the braces and add "def scaffold = Book". You should now see this:
    <br>
    <img src="../../../images_www/articles/72/web/grails/grails-65-13.png" class="margin-around b-all" alt="screenshot of class in editor"></li>
</ol>   

<a name="running"></a>
<h2>Running the Application</h2>
<p>Our simple Grails application is now complete. In this section, we deploy it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the application and choose "Run". The application is deployed to Jetty, as you can see in the Services window:
  <br><img src="../../../images_www/articles/72/web/grails/grails-65-19.png" class="margin-around b-all" alt="screenshot of Services window"></li>
<li>The URL is printed to the Output window. If the browser does not open
 automatically, paste the URL into a browser and then you'll see your application.
 Click the "BookController" link and you'll see this:
<br><img src="../../../images_www/articles/72/web/grails/grails-65-14.png" class="margin-around b-all" alt="screenshot of list in browser window"></li>
<li>Click New Book and then create a new entry:
    <br><img src="../../../images_www/articles/72/web/grails/grails-65-15.png" class="margin-around b-all" alt="screenshot of create entry page in browser window"></li>
<li>When you click Create, note that you can edit or delete the entry:
 <br><img src="../../../images_www/articles/72/web/grails/grails-65-17.png" class="margin-around b-all" alt="screenshot of edit page in browser window"></li>
<li>...and that the entry is reflected in the list of entries:
 <br><img src="../../../images_www/articles/72/web/grails/grails-65-18.png" class="margin-around b-all" alt="screenshot of list page in browser window with new entry"></li>
</ol>
