Hi, this video demonstrates how to get a Git project by cloning an existing Git repository from  GitHub using NetBeans IDE.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:23,666
Before starting to clone a Git repository you need to ensure that you have a GitHub account, you are a GitHub project member,  

3
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:37,066
and you know a Git repository URL.For non-automated SSH access, you need to have a private SSH key in the OpenSSH format 

4
00:00:37,066 --> 00:00:46,599
and a passphrase.For automated SSH access, you need to correctly configure SSH-agent or Pageant. 

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
In NetBeans IDE, choose Team > Git > Clone from the main menu. 

6
00:00:56,066 --> 00:01:00,132
The Clone Repository wizard displays.

7
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:04,566
Specify the GitHub repository URL.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Enter git in the Username field.

9
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,800
Select the Private/Public Key option.

10
00:01:15,566 --> 00:01:19,566
Click Browse to get to your personal key location.

11
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,999
Click Open.

12
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:26,633
Enter the passphrase.

13
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:30,233
Note that if using Pageant both the fields are left empty.

14
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:33,499
As soon as the IDE gets authenticated access to the GitHub server, the Remote Branches page of the wizard displays.

15
00:01:34,366 --> 00:01:38,366
Click Next to continue.

16
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:47,066
As soon as the IDE gets authenticated access to the GitHub server, the Remote Branches page of the wizard displays.

17
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,566
Select the repository branch (or branches) to be downloaded to your local repository.

18
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,900
Click Next.

19
00:01:57,966 --> 00:02:03,899
At the Destination Directory page, modify the pre-filled options if required.

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,966
Note that origin is a recommended value as an alias of the repository being cloned.

21
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:22,900
To activate after-scanning right after the clone finishes, leave the Scan for NetBeans Projects after Clone option selected.

22
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:27,033
Click Finish.

23
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:32,799
After the repository is cloned, the Clone Completed message displays.

24
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:37,232
Click Open Project to view the cloned project. 

25
00:02:38,800 --> 00:03:00,066
The IDE opens a valid NetBeans project from the cloned repository in the Projects window.

26
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:11,599
Git actions are now available from the context menu and main menu for the cloned project.

27
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:21,733
In this video you learnt how to clone a Git project from a remote server via the SSH protocol.

28
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,666
Thank you for watching.
