<h1>NetBeans Localization and Translation Projects</h1>

<p>This is the place to find out about all the projects related to translating
NetBeans IDE, netbeans.org web content, newsletters, or NetBeans product information. 

<ul>
<li><a href="#website">Translating Website Content</a></li>
<li><a href="#ide">Localising the NetBeans IDE</a></li>
<li><a href="#newsletter">Translating and Publishing Newsletters</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="website"><h2>Translating Website Content</h2></a>

<p>Getting important web content translated into different languages is a
high priority for the project.  The docs and web teams have put together a kit 
of pages which are suitable for translation.  The kit includes some of the product
and feature info pages, for people new to NetBeans, as well as tutorial and
documentation sets.  Anyone is free, and very welcome, to pick a page from the
kit and translate it.  Any contribution, even a single page, is a great help.</p>

<p><a name="start"><h3>How to get started</h3></a></p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Check <a href="localisation-status.html">the status page</a> to see what has
  been done, what needs updating, and what hasn't been started.  Pick a page you'd
  like to work on.</li>

<li>Note that the page may not list all the languages. If your language is not listed, open the English doc you would like to translate and search whether the page is available in your language by clicking the "Choose page language" link.</li>

<li>Post a note to the <a href="mailto:dev@nblocalization.netbeans.org">NB localization team</a>, so others
  know you will be working on that page.</li>

<li>Read <a href="http://nblocalization.netbeans.org/docs/first_steps.html">First Steps</a> in order to contribute: Please sign the <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/opensource/sca.pdf">Contributor Agreement</a> and register with <a href="http://translate.sun.com/opencti/">OpenCTI</a>, our editor for translations.</li>

<li>A project will be created for you in <a href="http://translate.sun.com/opencti/">OpenCTI</a>.</li>

<li>You can start your translation activities.</li>

<li>Once you finish, send a note to the team and the page/s will be published on nb.org.</li>

<li>Thanks.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>If you'd like to get more involved, or plan to translate more than a single page,
you might like to get in touch with other community members working on translations
into your language.  Check <a href="http://nblocalization.netbeans.org/index-teams.html">the
list of localization teams</a>, subscribe and send a note to your language's list.</p>

<a name="ide"><h2>Localising the NetBeans IDE</h2></a>

<p>Join the community-driven effort to translate the IDE into your native language.
The <A HREF="http://nblocalization.netbeans.org/">NBlocalization project</A>
is where it all happens.  To get started:

<UL>
<LI>Check out the docs and HOWTOs on the nblocalization website, get
a feel for what's involved and what's required.

<LI><A HREF="mailto:sympa@nblocalization.netbeans.org?subject=subscribe dev">Subscribe to
the dev@nblocalization.netbeans.org</A>
mailing list and post an introductory message stating what language
you'd like to help with.  There may be other users already working on
localization into that language, so use the list to co-ordinate your
efforts.
</UL>
</p>

<a name="newsletter"><h2>Translating and Publishing Newsletters</h2></a>

<p>Every week a newsletter is published on the site, and distributed via
email to subscribers.  You can localize the content of that English newsletter
and add your own stories to create a version in your language.  That version
will be published on the netbeans.org site, and distributed via email to your
language mailing list (see the existing <a href="../lists/top.html#localised">language mailing lists</a>).
If you're interested in doing this, please see the 
<a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/NBWeeklyNewsML">How To Publish the NetBeans Weekly Newsletter in Your Language</a>
wiki guide.</p>
