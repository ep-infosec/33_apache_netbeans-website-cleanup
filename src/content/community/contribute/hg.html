<h1>Getting Mercurial push access</h1>

<br>While the netbeans.org Mercurial repositories allow anonymous read access, an
account must be specifically granted permissions to write ("push") to the
repository.  This page outlines the process for requesting such permission.

<a name="src"></a><h2>Requesting commit access for the NetBeans sources</h2>

<p>If you would like to work seriously on a piece of existing NetBeans
code:

<OL>

<LI> Make sure you are subscribed to (and read!) the relevant mailing
lists so that you know what is going on in that area of development.
It is also necessary to subscribe to the
<A HREF="../lists/other.html#build">broken builds notification mailing list</A>.<P></LI>

<LI> Make sure you have looked through the existing source code and
understand what it is doing and how. If something is poorly documented,
confusing, or you just can't grasp what is going on, ask on nbdev@netbeans.org
for a summary. Probably the original developer should write
better Javadoc or other documentation to explain it anyway.<P></LI>

<LI> Make sure you <A HREF="https://netbeans.org/people/new">have a login</A> on the
site. Anyone can make one for him or herself (but without any special
permissions). You will need one for using Issuezilla, Mercurial, and so on.<P></LI>

<LI> <A HREF="patches.html">Submit some patches</A> so that it is
clear you know what you are doing.<P></LI>

<li><p>Ask an existing committer to be given push permission to the desired
repository, and explain what sorts of things you are interested in doing with
it. You will need to communicate frequently with person or people who already
maintain that area of code, so make sure there is an agreement on what you
should be working on. The module owner ought to mention on nbdev new people he
or she is approving as developers with a summary of what they are working on,
and initially take responsibility for making sure they know what to do.<p></li>

<LI> Also mention in writing that you understand that your work is on
<a href="https://netbeans.org/cddl-gplv2.html">Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL) v1.0 and the GNU General Public License (GPL) v2</a> code and that you agree
that all changes you make are things you write yourself and that they can be
incorporated under these licenses.<P></LI>

<li><p>You must have filled in
a Contributor Agreement - see <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/oca-faq-405384.pdf">the CA
Policy</a> page for more info.  No code can be committed until a
CA is completed.<P></LI>

<LI> If approved, you can begin working.
Make sure you understand which Mercurial repository (branch) you are supposed to be working on!
Also make sure you read and understand the <A HREF="../guidelines/commit.html">Commit Rules</A>.
<P></LI>

<LI> Make modifications and enhancements and talk about them on the
associated mailing lists.<P></LI>
