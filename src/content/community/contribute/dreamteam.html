<b>The NetBeans Dream Team

lists and developer forums, providing new, interesting and informative
content as well as developing new and creative ways to promote NetBeans. <br>

<h2>Overview </h2>

<p>The first phase of the <em>NetBeans Dream Team</em>, is to provide a basic framework
that the elected members can use in the creation of a formal program.&nbsp; This program, being a community-based initiative, is
now being designed by the community leaders who have helped to shape
the NetBeans project.
