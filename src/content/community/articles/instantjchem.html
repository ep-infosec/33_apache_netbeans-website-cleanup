<h1>Instant JChem - An Integrated Environment for Scientists, Built on NetBeans</h1>
  <span style="font-style: italic;">August 2007</span><br>
<br>
<br>
When <a href="http://www.chemaxon.com/">Chemaxon</a>, a Budapest-based
chemical software development firm, set out to create <a
 href="http://www.chemaxon.com/product/ijc.html">Instant JChem</a>, an
out-of-box application that would let scientists work easily with
chemical structures, the NetBeans Platform was an undisputed choice for
the development team of Tim Dudgeon and Petr Hamernik.<br>
<br>
"We used NetBeans because it is an extensible modular application built
on Java," Dudgeon said in a recent interview. "The window management
side of things: the way you can put together parts of the application
and get all the benefits of the windowing system; the APIs and building
wizards with them—these were all very important to us."<br>
<br>
While selecting a tool that addressed and satisfied many of the
project's parameters was a given, there was also past
experience to consider.<br>
<br>
Dudgeon, a scientist and developer, and the founder of <a
 href="http://www.informaticsmatters.com/">Informatics Matters</a>, a
software solutions and consultancy firm, has used the NetBeans Platform
for previous projects for other companies. Hamernik was one of the
original creators of NetBeans, and has also worked with Dudgeon on
custom applications built on NetBeans.<br>
<br>
In defense of what might appear to be a development tool bias,
Hamernik, who is now an independent developer, pointed out that the
team's choice was not based solely on personal preference but on which
platform had the easiest framework to work with.<br>
<br>
"Eclipse has its own native widgets, UI and visual components, which
were difficult to manipulate," Hamernik asserted. "NetBeans is
Java-based and has a straight-forward framework that&nbsp; was very
helpful in creating a Swing-heavy application like Instant JChem."<br>

Instant JChem belongs to a class of chemistry applications that
function much like IDEs for those working in the pharmaceutical and
bio-tech industries. But instead of code, these applications handle
chemical and biological data.<br>
<br>
A desktop software that houses the functionality of other Chemaxon
tools, Instant JChem allows chemists and biologists to create, manage
and analyze hundreds of thousands of chemical structures in a
database-conducive environment. It is also a platform on which other
chemistry applications can be built.<br>
<br>
"Representing scientific data as searchable data is quite complex and
different than when dealing with numeric data," Dudgeon explained. "One
problem with some of the powerful tools out there is that you need to
have some background to use them, and tools that are simpler to work
with lack power. [Scientists] want a powerful yet easy-to-use
application that lets them sketch structures and run queries
efficiently while insulating them from the complexities of how."<br>
<br>
With Instant JChem, users can easily create, connect and share local
databases, and also connect to external ones. Structure files can be
imported, exported and merged, their data tabulated, sorted and
queried. There is support for 2D and 3D structure display, and
relational data. Users can build or apply their own chemical business
rules; the tool also allows for third-party functionality to be
integrated.<br>
<br>
In the past, drug research and life science companies often built their
own database tools or hired firms like Chemaxon to build them, while
the average scientist had to pay thousands of dollars for such software
on the market. Instant JChem offers a solution for both groups, a
ready-made application that's easy to install and that runs out of the
box. The database tool is free for individual and academic use;
however, accessing external database engines requires a license key
that can be purchased from Chemaxon. Chemistry plugins are also
available.<br>
<br>
Hamernik and Dudgeon said they worked with the NetBeans Platform 5.5
and later, milestones of 6.0 with minimal problems. They even used what
Dudgeon termed a "NetBeans approach" by rolling out milestone releases
of Instant JChem. The response to Instant JChem at user group meetings,
from scientists, and other companies, they said, have been positive.
The team plans to release Instant JChem 2.0 in late August 2007. The
release will include improvements to relational data support,
multi-user access and a form design similar to NetBeans's GUI builder.
There has also been a major rewrite of the architecture.<br>
<br>
Chemaxon's marketing director Allan Allardyce expressed excitement
about the upcoming release.<br>
<br>
"Instant JChem could move the field of cheminformatics," he said.
(Cheminformatics deals with the representation and use of chemical
structures and related information on computer.)&nbsp; "It's a very
cool and modern-looking tool with search capabilities to draw and
perceive chemical structures at the very highest level. It's great for
someone who doesn't want to spend money on software to explore chemical
information. Yet, it is also a state-of-the-art application for the
biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry."<br>
