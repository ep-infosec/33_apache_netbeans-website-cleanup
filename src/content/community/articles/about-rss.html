<h1>What is RSS ?</h1>

<P>"Really Simple Syndiation", or "Rich Site Summary", is an
XML format used for syndicating or sharing content, most
commonly News headlines.  An RSS file supplies a feed of
headlines, links and article summaries to RSS-aware clients,
and even other websites.

<P>netbeans.org provides an RSS feed which includes news items,
Featured Articles, and the current Newsletters.  Point your
clients at
<A HREF="https://netbeans.org/rss-091.xml">https://netbeans.org/rss-091.xml</A>
to see the NetBeans feed.

<P>There are quite a few different RSS formats around.  netbeans.org's
feed is RSS 0.91, which is a very simple format.  Most if not all
clients should be able to use this RSS version.  If not, or if
you'd like us to implement a different version,
<a href="https://netbeans.org/about/contact_form.html?to=1">drop us a line</A> and
let us know why, we're open to suggestions!
