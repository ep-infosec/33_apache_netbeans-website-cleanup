<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p><h3>What makes NetBeans the best?</h3>

<p>Abstract: Is NetBeans a platform or an IDE? NetBeans is both. It's a
platform for developing rich client applications <em>and</em> it's an
award-winning Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This session
provides an introduction to the world of NetBeans, including a tour of
the distinguishing features in the IDE. It also highlights the most
important new features in the upcoming NetBeans 5.0 release:
enhancements to the editor, new CVS support, more types of refactoring,
module development support, and the highly-anticipated Project Matisse.</p>

<p><h3>What makes NetBeans the best IDE for J2ME development?</h3>

<p>Abstract: J2ME development requires a specific set of tools.  The
NetBeans IDE provides a first class set of tools for developing mobile
Java applications.  This session is an introduction to J2ME and
demonstrates the features of the NetBeans IDE Mobility Pack.  The
ultra-cool visual designer will be demonstrated, along with wizards that
support wireless connection and procide a unique solution to the device
fragmentation problem.</p>

<p><h3>What makes NetBeans the best IDE for J2EE development?</h3>

<p>Abstract: NetBeans provides a trouble-free out-of-box experience for
J2EE developers. There's no need to search for plug-ins; the NetBeans
IDE provides you with the tools you need to start being productive right
away. These include: sample J2EE code & blueprints with documentation,
tight integration with a growing list of application servers, and lots
of powerful tools: editors, debuggers, profilers, wizards, etc.</p>
