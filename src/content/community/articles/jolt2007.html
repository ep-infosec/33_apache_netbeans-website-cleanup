<h1>NetBeans Wins Jolt Awards</h1>
<i>March 22, 2007</i><br>
<br><br>
NetBeans was a multiple winner at the <a
 href="http://www.joltawards.com/2007/">17th Annual Jolt Product
Excellence Awards</a> ceremony which was held last night at the SD West
Conference in Santa Clara, California.<br>
<br>
The NetBeans 5.5 IDE picked up an award for Best Development
Environment, and the NetBeans Mobility Pack 5.5 and the NetBeans Visual
Web Pack both received Community Awards for mobile development and web
development respectively.<br>
<br>
Jeetendra Kaul, Vice President of Developer Products and Programs for Sun
Microsystems, accepted the awards on behalf of NetBeans and thanked
Jolt judges and the software industry for acknowledging NetBeans at an
opportune time, citing the company's growth in the past two years with
over 13 million downloads, a half-million mailing list subscribers and
more than 100 partners.<br>
<br>
In his acceptance speech, Kaul focused on attributes that have won
NetBeans and its products praise from critics and acceptance within the
developer community. He touched on the IDE's all-in-one functionality
for mobile, web and enterprise application development; NetBeans's continuing
leadership in the area of Java EE 5 support and most recently for Ruby, and
more. <br>
<br>
&#8220;Improving developer productivity through innovation is clearly a
winner,&#8221; he said.<br>
<br>
Regarded as the &#8220;Oscars&#8221; of the software industry, the Jolt Awards
recognize software products, books, and websites that have achieved
excellence in the areas of functionality, usability, problem-solving
and innovation. <br>
<br>
The NetBeans Mobility Pack was a <a
