<h1>NetBeans Mobility Pack with Java ME Guidelines
Unveiled at Orange Camp</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">
Are developers a few steps closer to making fragmentation in mobile
devices a challenge of the past? Sun Microsystems and Orange, the
mobile telecommunications giant, are hard at work to help make that a
reality.<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><br>
The quest to reduce fragmentation in mobile devices and the partnership
between Sun and Orange received yet another boost at the latter’s fifth
biannual Partner Camp when Sun and Orange engineers introduced the much
anticipated <a
 href="http://developers.sun.com/techtopics/mobility/reference/techart/design_guidelines/">
Developer Guidelines and Best Practices</a> and the <a
 href="https://netbeans.org/features/javame/index.html">NetBeans
Mobility Pack</a> for Orange to a receptive audience.<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><br>
The three-day conference, held in late October in Cadiz, Spain, brought
together Java engineers and developers, and executives looking to
network and exchange ideas about products, trends and solutions for the
mobile communications industry. The event also offered a first showing
of the Developer Guidelines and Best Practices, a joint project by Sun
and Orange engineers to provide Java ME developers with tools to create
applications that are compatible across a range of mobile devices and
operators, a goal outlined last May at JavaOne when the two companies
publicly announced their partnership.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><br>
Creating several hundred versions of one Java application to run on
different types of mobile devices is an expensive and inefficient
process for developers. The Developer Guidelines and Best Practices
examine some of the causes of fragmentation and suggest steps for
writing applications that require fewer versions to run on several
handsets. The guidelines and practices are available as part of the
NetBeans Mobility Pack which allows developers to create, test and
debug applications for mobile devices. The guidelines and practices can
also be downloaded from <a href="http://developers.sun.com/index.html">
developers.sun.com</a> and the Orange Partner site.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><br>
NetBeans engineer Adam Sotona participated in a presentation, led by
Orange, on de-fragmentation. The panel of engineers discussed
highlights from the guidelines and Sotona gave a demonstration of the
guidelines using NetBeans Mobility Pack with plug-ins for Orange.
According to Sotona, many ME developers incorrectly classified
fragmentation as a problem best left to mobile operators to solve. With
the guidelines, developers now had the tools and incentive to take an
active role in finding solutions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><br>
But the work to reduce fragmentation is far from finished. Sotona and
other engineers on the project hope to expand on the guidelines and
best practices with help from the Java ME community. The ongoing goal
is to find solutions to existing and new fragmentation problems and
improve on current solutions whenever possible.</p>
