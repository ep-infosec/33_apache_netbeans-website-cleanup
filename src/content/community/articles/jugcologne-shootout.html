<h1>NetBeans To Take on Rival IDEs at JUG Cologne Shootout<br>
</h1>
<span style="font-style: italic;">June 28, 2007</span><br>
<br>
<br>
The rules are simple: Get on stage and give a 30-minute presentation.
If a rival makes an unwanted remark, feel free—but at your own risk—to
use your laptop as a projectile object.<br>
<br>
Welcome to <a
 href="http://huettermann.net/media/JUGC-IDE-Bashing-03-07-07">JUG
Cologne's IDE Shootout</a> where four top IDEs—NetBeans, Oracle,
Eclipse and JetBrains—are set to face off on July 3rd. The event will
be held at the University of Cologne (Germany), with NetBeans
Evangelist <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roumen/">Roman Strobl</a>
representing the NetBeans IDE!<br>
<br>
The shootout is the first-ever multiple IDE session for <a
 href="http://jugcologne.org/">JUG Cologne</a>. <br>
<br>
According to JUG leader and event moderator Michael Hutterman, the idea
of an IDE face-off occurred to him when he considered re-inviting
JetBrains, a past JUG Cologne guest, to give another presentation.<br>
<br>
“In the past, I had one dedicated JetBrains IDEA event that was a big
success and I wanted to re-invite them once again,” Hutterman said.
“Because I know NetBeans has great community support here I thought of
inviting NetBeans as well. But then what's an IDE Shootout without
Eclipse? Then a JUG member asked about Oracle....”<br>
<br>
NetBeans Evangelist Roman Strobl said he immediately agreed to
participate when asked, citing the shootout as a unique event to
showcase
NetBeans's new features to the developer community in Cologne and to
put other IDEs on alert.<br>
<br>
“I thought it would be fun to have four different IDE vendors on
stage,” Strobl said. “NetBeans has been improving significantly over
the past several years, and we now have some interesting features that
are absent in the other IDEs. So I think I might surprise some of the
developers with how far NetBeans has come, especially with the 6.0
release."<br>
<br>
The shootout panelists each get 30 minutes to make the case
for their IDE. At the end of all segments, the panel and the audience
will have an hour-long open discussion. Shootouts
normally end with a publicly declared winner; at the end of the Cologne
event however, no winner will be announced. Instead,
developers will be left to conclude on their own about which IDE has
made the strongest impact or best
suits their needs.<br>
<br>
“The shootout's goal is not to blame any one IDE, but to bring them to
the community in Cologne and the whole Rhine area,” Hutterman
explained, adding that Cologne was a major IT city with a vibrant
developer
community hungry for more unique events such as shootouts,
which were a welcome departure from larger, multi-day conferences.<br>
<br>
Strobl approved of the shootout's alternative approach: “There's
obviously no clear winner in terms of functionality. Developers
should learn about what are the strong and weak parts of each IDE." But
he said he was looking forward to audience feedback during the open
discussion segment set to follow the individual
presentations.<br>
<br>
And about those flying laptops? Although Hutterman said violence was
not expected, he conceded that it was a
possibility—with the right lightweight notebook.<br>
