            I hope to meet James Gosling, I think that what we are doing
            is a great extension of his vision. There are also quite a
            lot of Java champions that I would like to talk to. There
            are quite a few interesting sessions on my schedule, both in
            enterprise deployment and client development.<br>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li> Practical Pros and Cons of Replacing Swing with
                JavaFX in Existing Applications - We have a lot of Swing
                code and are pretty much struggling with incorporating
                FX features such as WebKit. Plus great speaker list.</li>
              <li> High-Performance Java Applications Without Dynamic
                Code: Ahead-of-Time Code Generators for iOS - Sounds
                really interesting and relevant to what we are doing.</li>
              <li>Architecting Enterprise JavaFX 8 - I don't think
                JavaFX has a future, but if someone can convince me
                otherwise its Adam Bien.</li>

            In my Java FX talk, I would like to introduce my way of
            building Model View Presenter JavaFX applications with Scene
            Builder, Maven and Dependency Injection.<br>
            <br>
            In the Java EE related sessions, I'm intending to bust some
            myths at the beginning session "Demystifying Java EE". <br>
            <br>
            In the session "Lean and Opinionated Java EE 7
            Applications", I plan to discuss Java EE 7 architectures
            with some patterns and idioms. Consistency and simplicity
            are key. Code walk-throughs are included.<br>
            <br>
            In my "Unit Tests Don't Break: Stress-Testing Java EE
            Applications", I would like to stress test a Java EE 7
            application, live and on stage, and address some pitfalls at
            the same time. Don't expect too much slides in my sessions.
            I usually use source code to explain my intentions.<br>
            <br>
            ...and I'm really looking forward to the "Cool NetBeans Tips
            and Tricks for Java EE 7 Development" session. Last year it
            was fun to hack something on stage with NetBeans in the
            crowded room. Btw. I'm using NetBeans in all my projects as
            well, so to minimize the risk I will use NetBeans in all my
            sessions as well :-)<br>

            </b><b>What are you looking forward to at JavaOne?</b><br>
            <br>
            I'm really looking forward to attend the sessions and
            keynotes delivered by Oracle engineers. JavaOne is the
            unique opportunity to meet the engineers who actually build
            Java itself. It is always valuable to attend a session from
            someone who actually implements Java and not only talks
            about that.&nbsp; I'm also curious about the news /
            announcements around Java.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Do you have any tips to share about how to best enjoy the
              conference and San Francisco?</b><br>
            <br>
            JavaOne means to me one thing: technical content. Everything
            else is secondary. For that reason I enroll for the sessions
            early and attempt to attend as many sessions as only
            possible. This was my strategy from the first JavaOne I
            attended in 2000. I also try to avoid parties. They are not
            compatible with consumption of technical content.<br>

            I'll be co-speaking at the session: <i>10 Tips for Java EE
              7 with PrimeFaces</i>. In the session, we will take you on
            a JSF tour with the help of Java EE 7 together with
            PrimeFaces and NetBeans IDE. The tour will begin with an
            introduction of PrimeFaces and its features, such as UI
            components and themes. Focusing on Java EE 7, we will
            examine HTML5 friendly templates, resource libraries
            contracts, faces flow, EL operators, and lambda magic.
            Throughout, you will be shown how to apply the principles
            and concepts learned through working examples in NetBeans
            IDE. The talk will be brought to you "from the horse's
            mouth", that is, by engineers from PrimeFaces and NetBeans
            IDE. <br>

            <span>Breezy city! Make sure to keep warm--load up on free
              coffee. Be aware that shuttles between the venues provide
              free transfer. The exhibition hall is the best place to
              meet up and chat with new people. If you see me--I'll be
              wearing a PrimeFaces tshirt--come say hello! :)<br>
              <br>
              There are lots of places to wander around in San
              Francisco. The crab shacks and the pier are a must-visit
              for me! The seafood is worth trying if you're into that.

            <br>
            There are so many highly talented members of the Java
            community that mostly get to interact online and rarely have
            a chance to meet in person. JavaOne gives me the opportunity
            to interact with these individuals in person. Additionally,
            I especially like the sessions that give a "sneak peek" at
            what's coming in the near future for the technologies and
            products I use day to day such as Java EE, GlassFish and
            NetBeans. <br>

            I have been to JavaOne a few times. In no particular order,
            here are a few things that first time attendees may not be
            aware of:<br>

            If your hotel is not walking distance from the conference,
            there are free shuttles provided to and from the conference,
            so no need to walk a few miles back and forth nor spend
            money on taxis.<br>
            <br>
            For those of us that need our caffeine fix, free coffee is
            provided at the conference.<br>
            <br>
            There is usually a 30 minute period of "down time" between
            sessions, use this time wisely and try to get to the
            sessions early so that you get a good seat.<br>
            <br>
            You will be getting a lot of information in a short time,
            like drinking water our of a fire hydrant. It's impossible
            to digest everything at once, but you will certainly go back
            home with lots of fresh ideas to apply to your software
            development projects. </td>

            <div>I will be talking about the great combination of HTML5
              on the frontend and Java EE 7 on the backend--it's as if
              they were made for each other. And of course about
              NetBeans, which supports both and helps you develop HTML5
              and Java EE 7 applications not only for the desktop, but
              also for mobile devices. <a
                href="https://netbeans.org/community/releases/74/">NetBeans
                7.4</a> contains many improvements for HTML5 developers
              (also known as Project Easel) as well as new support for
              Java EE 7. Hence, the title of my talk: <i>Coding for

              titled<i> Red Hat and Oracle: Delivering on the Promise of
                Interoperability in Java EE 7</i>, we will highlight the
              interoperability and vendor-neutral focus of the new Java
              EE 7 platform and demonstrate how the same application
              works easily on both GlassFish and JBoss. While this talk
              is primarily concerned about server-side code, we will
              also touch on tools (including NetBeans 7.4) as well as
              client-side technologies.</div>

            HTML5 and Java EE 7 work great together, and NetBeans 7.4 is
            an excellent tool for both.<br>

            working on, and to meet people who are passionate about
            Java.<br>

            <br>
            Try to be busy. Attend every session you are at least mildly
            interested in. Don't miss any opportunity to meet new
            people, and to chat with the people you already know. Tour
            the exhibition floor and stop at the booths. Go to parties.
            Don't be afraid to ask questions in the sessions. I know
            that doing all this is very demanding and tiring, and in the
            evenings you will be exhausted, but in retrospect you will
            find this very rewarding.<br>

            I'll talk about the Gradle integration of NetBeans. As a
            short demonstration, it is quite challenging to choose what
            not to include. Therefore, I plan to demonstrate only
            features that are easy to miss. For example: How to specify
            using a particular Gradle version without (manually)
            downloading Gradle; Custom task variables, which can be used
            to create custom project wizards. Also, I hope to exploit
            the new Tooling API (currently being developed) of Gradle
            1.8 to significantly improve the plugin before JavaOne. <br>

            new feature requests. :) As for sessions, my favorite
            subject is concurrency, so I'm sure to attend to some
            related sessions (e.g.: CON7962).<br>

            This will be my first time at JavaOne. I wanted to attend to
            JavaOne in the past but I was discouraged by the time
            required to travel to San Francisco. I hope Oracle will
            consider moving JavaOne to Budapest :). </td>
