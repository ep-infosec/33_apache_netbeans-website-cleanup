<h4>What do you do at ICEsoft?</h4>
I'm a senior architect on ICEfaces.
<br>
<br>
<h4>As a partner, how has your company contributed to the NetBeans
Project?</h4>
ICEsoft has contributed to NetBeans by providing modules
for easily working with ICEfaces applications within
the IDE. One module supports the developer at the
project level by automatically configuring the Servlets
in the application for the Ajax features of ICEfaces.
Another module supports the developer at the design level
by providing drag-and-drop design with ICEfaces components
with the Visual Web Pack. We're also working on integrating
ICEfaces seam-gen capabilities with Petr Pisl's Seam
Integration module. <br>
<br>
<h4>Please tell us about your NetBeans Day Presentation.</h4>
The theme of talk is how using an IDE,
specifically NetBeans, makes it easy to develop Ajax applications.
There are a variety of ways to do this with NetBeans, and it's very
effective for that. We'll also explain the technique for making
multi-user applications called Ajax Push and say a few things
every Ajax developer needs to know about security.<br>
<br>
<h4>Why is your session important for developers?</h4>
Ajax applications are tedious to develop by hand, but by combining
NetBeans with current Ajax frameworks such as DynaFaces, jMaki, and
ICEfaces, you can develop Ajax and Ajax Push applications very
effectively.<br>
<br>
It's exciting because Ajax is the new way to develop applications on
the web, and users are expecting Ajax capabilities more and more. By
attending
this talk, developers will see how they can easily develop Ajax
applications
within the Java standards.<br>
<br>
<h4>Is there a main message you want developers to get from
your session?</h4>
Ajax and Ajax Push applications can be readily developed using
DynaFaces, jMaki, or ICEfaces with the NetBeans IDE.<br>
<br>
<h4>Is this your first time holding a talk at NetBeans Day or JavaOne?<br>
</h4>
We presented in 2005, explaining the underlying Direct-to-DOM mechanism
used by the underlying Ajax technology ICEfaces. This session is quite
different, focusing on how developers can develop Ajax applications
themselves.<br>
<br>
<h4>What features do you enjoy working with in NetBeans?</h4>
Most interesting is the Visual Web Pack—introduced by Creator, but
inconvenient because it was part of a non-mainstream IDE.&nbsp; Visual
Web Pack really fulfills
the promise of JSF by allowing developers to work with components in a
visual way.<br>
<br>
<h4>How does working in Java compare with other technologies?</h4>
Java is the most effective software platform. It promotes secure
software and promotes practices that allow developers to work together
as a team. JSF is easy to get started on when you see how well the
design and
development are separated with the beans and the pages.<br>
<br>
<h4>What are the benefits of your project to the community?</h4>
ICEfaces.org has a thriving community since ICEfaces is open source
under the Mozilla Public License.&nbsp; It lets people develop Ajax
applications with server-side rather than client side technologies
(clearly
important to the Java developer) entirely with open source.<br>
<br>
<h4>Are there any other messages you would like to highlight in this
interview?</h4>
Using NetBeans in combination with DynaFaces, jMaki, or ICEfaces you
can effectively develop Ajax and Ajax Push applications.<br>
