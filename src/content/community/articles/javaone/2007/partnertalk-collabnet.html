<h4>What is your role at CollabNet?</h4>
I have a couple of primary job functions which both qualify me for this
presentation. First, I am a Senior Product Manager at CollabNet focused
on the road map for our contributions to the Subversion project. As the
primary commercial sponsor of Subversion since its inception, CollabNet
is uniquely positioned to speak on this topic and in turn, my role in
product management of Subversion does the same. Secondly, I work within
the Services team to provide consulting and training around Subversion.
That means I see the practical implementations of its use.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Your company is a NetBeans partner. What have you done with
NetBeans?</h4>
CollabNet hosts and manages the NetBeans.org site. In addition,
CollabNet is partnering with the NetBeans community to offer a
Subversion plug-in and value-added services around Subversion.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Tell us about your NetBeans Day Presentation.</h4>
I will be making a presentation on Subversion and the integration to it
that was developed for NetBeans.
<br>
<br>
<h4>What's the top point that developers should know about your session?</h4>
That a top notch integration is available that will allow them to use
Subversion from within their NetBeans development environment and that
there are resources to help make them successful in doing so.
Subversion is the leading open-source version control tool as well as
the overall fastest growing version control tool today. The community
can benefit from the integrated use of Subversion to satisfy their
version control requirements and do so seamlessly from within the
NetBeans platform.
<br>
<br>
<h4>What is the main message you want a developer to get after
attending your session?</h4>
I want developers to understand that they can leverage the strengths of
both NetBeans and Subversion through the integration that has been
developed. I want them to appreciate the power provided by the
combination of the two tools.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Why did you submit your session to be presented at NetBeans Day?
</h4>
Subversion is the fastest growing version control tool in the market
today and NetBeans has a very strong integration to it for which
CollabNet provided guidance. I felt it was important to bring the focus
of both communities together on this valuable integration. I presented
a similar session at the NetBeans Day in Atlanta in January.
<br>
<br>
<h4>What features in NetBeans do you enjoy working with?</h4>
Not being in our engineering department, I can't really say whether we
use NetBeans and how it might be helping. I can say that I am very
impressed with the Subversion integration as compared to integrations
developed for other IDEs.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Are there any other messages you would like to highlight in this
interview?</h4>
That not only is there a powerful integration of these two tools, but
there are two strong organizations ready and able to support those that
choose to use them.
