<p>The second annual NetBeans Software Day in San Francisco was a resounding
success â€” so much so, that walls had to be moved to accomodate the standing-
room-only crowd.

<p>The event was a great opportunity for community members to
meet each other face-to-face. Attendees also met the developers of NetBeans, saw
demos of upcoming NetBeans IDE features, and attended talks where they learned
how to write plug-ins for NetBeans and  how to get the most out of advanced
features such as the NetBeans Profiler. The day ended with a special
presentation of the <a href="community-awards.html">NetBeans Community Awards</a>.

<p>NetBeans Software Day 2005 took place on June 26 at the Argent Hotel in San
Francisco. It was held a companion event to the JavaOne Developers' Conference
which began the following day. NetBeans Software Day was free for anyone who
wanted to attend and ran from noon into the evening.

<p>The NetBeans project team takes this opportunity to congratulate our Special
Guests, Presenters, Community Award winners, attendees, and other supporters who
made this incredible event possible!

<p><h2>Couldn't make it to NetBeans Day? Want to come to the next one?</h2>
Good news! NetBeans Software Day presentations are now <a href="#presentations">available online</a>.
We are also taking NetBeans Software Day on an around the world tour! Our first
stop will be in China on Sept 12, 2005, the day before JavaChina. More details
will be posted soon on <a href="http://www.javachina.cn/">JavaChina.cn</a>.

<p>On behalf of the NetBeans project team we would like to thank everyone
who attended and supports NetBeans for making this incredible event
possible!
