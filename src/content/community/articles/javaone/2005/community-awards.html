        <h1>NetBeans Community Honors Contributors</h1>

        <p>At this year's NetBeans Software Day, five members of the IDE's
        global development community were honored for their valuable
        contributions to the NetBeans platform. Each winner received a framed
        plaque (designed by James Gosling) and a new Sun "developer machine" -
        an Ultra 20 Opteron workstation that comes with the Java Desktop System
        and a suite of Java technology developer tools preinstalled.

        <p>Most of the winners have been involved with the NetBeans community
        for many years. Only one of five works for a company which creates
        software that interoperates with NetBeans. These individuals became
        involved with NetBeans because they support open source software
        development and wanted to make a difference.

        <p>Unfortunately, not all of the winners could be at the event in
        person.  The NetBeans development community takes this opportunity to
        congratulate this year's winners and thank them for their continued
        support:

        <li><i><a href="http://today.java.net/pub/au/117">Vincent Brabant</a></i>
        - Vincent works for a telecom company in Brussels, Belgium. He first
        used NetBeans 3.0 when taking a Java technology course in 2002. Vincent
        launched the TranslatedFiles project as a community center for people
        doing translations of NetBeans and has localized the IDE, documentation
        and parts of NetBeans.org in French. He was a past member of the
        NetBeans governance board.

        <p><li>
        <i><a href="http://today.java.net/pub/au/116">Maxym Mykhalchuk</a></i>
         - Maxym lives in the Ukraine and is working on his Ph.D.
         involvingcomputer-assisted translation. In 2002, he started a project
         to localize NetBeans in Russian and currently manages the Russian-
         language mailing list. "...It's nice to know that there are people here
         on Earth you've never seen in person, but that you helped and they
         helped you..." says Maxym. He was also a past member of the NetBeans
         governance board.

        <p><li>
        <i><a href="http://www.manorrock.com/about.html">Manfred Riem</a></i>
        - Manfred is a long-time member of the NetBeans development community.
        He first started using NetBeans in 1999, when it was a commercial
        product yet to be acquired by Sun Microsystems. He has worked on the
        Dutch translation of the IDE and NetBeans.org content. "I didn't expect
        to win an award," says Manfred, "...being involved with NetBeans was and
        is for me something I like because it will benefit a lot of people."

        <p><li>
        <i><a href="http://today.java.net/pub/au/88">Bruno Souza</a></i>
        - Bruno can easily be recognized at the JavaOne developer conference as
        the guy wearing the Brazilian flag on his back. He has been tremendously
        active in popularizing NetBeans in his native Brazil, where he works as
        a consultant.

        <p><li>
        <i><a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/richunger/">Rich Unger</a></i>
        - Rich works for Nuance Communications as one of the lead developers of
        V-Builder, a development environment for Voice-XML (a tool for creating
        voice-based menus). V-Builder is built on the NetBeans platform and re-
        uses a number of plug-ins that can be found in the NetBeans IDE. "I like
        it when people write me or the list, saying they are using my code," he
        says. "I'll see email addresses from Turkey, China, or the JPL and think
        ‘Cool!’ I suppose, in any vibrant open source community, that's how just
        about everything gets done." Rich has been involved in NetBeans for a
        number of years, and has made many code contributions including the
        "cluster harness", which made it much easier to build applications on
        the NetBeans platform, and also wrote an excellent tutorial to go with
        it. Rich is a current member of the NetBeans board.
