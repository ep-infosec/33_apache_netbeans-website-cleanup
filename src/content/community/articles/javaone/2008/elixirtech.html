      <h1>NetBeans
Day 2008 Partner Spotlight</h1>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">The <a
 href="https://netbeans.org/community/partners/">NetBeans Partner
Program</a>
recognizes companies that add value to the
NetBeans Project by building plugins, endorsing NetBeans
as a development environment and/or application platform, and more. At <a
 href="https://netbeans.org/community/articles/javaone/2008/nb-day.html">NetBeans
Day 2008</a>, some of our partner companies will be on-hand to showcase
their technologies and to demonstrate the ways to extend and get the
most out of the NetBeans IDE! Here's a preview of what to expect.</span><br>

<h4>What is Elixir Technology and how did the company become involved
with
NetBeans? </h4>
<a href="http://www.elixirtech.com/">Elixir Technology</a> provides an
integrated Business Intelligence platform
for Dashboard, Report, Data ETL and Scheduling, based on REST-based Web
Services SOA. This award-winning product, Elixir Repertoire, is
developed entirely in Java and Swing, which makes it a natural fit for
NetBeans integration.&nbsp; Its REST interface should also appeal to
the NetBeans users who develop the next-generation Rich Internet
Applications (RIA). <br>
<br>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="0" cellpadding="2"

    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">
      <h4>Tell us about the Elixir Repertoire Plugin for NetBeans.</h4>
The <a href="http://www.elixirtech.com/NetBeans/">Repertoire Plugin</a>
is a full featured BI Designer to do the
following: <br>
      <br>
      <ul style="margin-left: 50px;">
        <li>Create interactive dashboards </li>
        <li>Design professional reports </li>
        <li>Define complex data transformations </li>
        <li>Schedule automated tasks</li>
      </ul>
While all these can be done in coding, this tool allows these designs
to be re-used and maintained with ease, freeing the developer to focus
on more demanding coding tasks. These functions can then be readily
incorporated into any application built with such as Java, JavaFX,
Ruby, Groovy, AJAX, etc - without having to install any connector or
clients. </td>

      </td>
    </tr>

<br>
With REST API as its underlying native interface, these BI
"resources" are accessed as lightweight web services using a simple set
of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operations over HTTP or HTTPS. Beyond just
accessing the templates, many other server functionalities are also
made available including its underlying security objects for Single
Sign-On, logs for centralized monitoring, and repository for automation
control.<br>
<br>
For those who prefer embedded mode, there is a Java API for connecting
to the Repertoire Server and another for embedding the Repertoire
Runtime. There are code samples provided for easy reference. <br>
<br>
The Repertoire Plugin is specially made available for FREE for NetBeans
users for development use! The Repertoire Server, Runtime, and Remote
are additional components available for licensing separately for
production use.&nbsp; <br>

<h4>Elixir has a variety of activities planned for NetBeans Day. Can
you
tell us about what to expect?</h4>
We will be launching Repertoire Plugin at CommunityOne, with every
participant receiving our software CD in their welcome pack. We'll also
be hosting a Demo Station so everyone can stop by to see the Plugin in
action. There is also a mind teaser challenge to win a limited edition
of the Elixir Puzzle Cube. <br>
<br>
<h4>Do you have other events planned for JavaOne? </h4>
Elixir will also host a booth at SOA Village area. <br>
<br>
<h4>What's the roadmap for your partnership with NetBeans? </h4>
Basically all our current features are already made available through
this Plugin. As we are new at this, we would want to gather feedback
from the NetBeans community to plan for future enhancements for the
Plugin.<br>
<br>
On partnership level, we are working out to be a Global Partner for Sun
Tech Days to spread the word around to those who can't make it to
CommunityOne, especially many of those outside US.<br>
