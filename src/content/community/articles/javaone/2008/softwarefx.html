Day 2008 Partner Spotlight</h1>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">The <a
 href="https://netbeans.org/community/partners/">NetBeans Partner
Program</a>
recognizes companies that add value to the
NetBeans Project by building plugins, endorsing NetBeans
as a development environment and/or application platform, and more. At <a
 href="https://netbeans.org/community/articles/javaone/2008/nb-day.html">NetBeans
Day 2008</a>, some of our partner companies will be on-hand to showcase
their technologies and to demonstrate the ways to extend and get the
most out of the NetBeans IDE! Here's a preview of what to expect.</span><br>

<h4>What is Software FX, and how did the company become involved with
NetBeans?</h4>
<a href="http://www.softwarefx.com/">Software FX, Inc</a> was founded
in September of 1993 as a component
vendor for the emerging visual development community, which capitalizes
on the increasing demand for reusable objects. By providing
top-of-the-line components for different development environments, we
continue to lead the market in deploying graphic development tools to
the expanding development community.<br>
<br>
While the company started out with COM-based products and then moved
into .NET products, it has always been our objective to provide
powerful data visualization solutions for developers in all
platforms.&nbsp;Therefore, in 2003 we released <a
 href="http://www.softwarefx.com/sfxJavaProducts/javaDeveloper/">Chart
FX for Java</a> 6.0
which brought the power and stability of Chart FX to the Java/jsp
platform.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
While designing and developing this first version of Chart FX for Java,
we became involved in the Java community to understand what the needs
of our future customer base would be, and what better way to do so than
to establish a close working relationship with Sun and the NetBeans
team. Those contacts would later lead to other collaborations and
ultimately to the current rewarding partnership.<br>

<h4>What were the benefits of integrating Chart FX with the NetBeans
IDE?</h4>
Our main goal as a component vendor is to create products that are
powerful and convenient to use at the same time. We have always strived
to give developers the best possible experience when using Chart FX in
their applications. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
For a charting component with 500+ properties, it was imperative for us
to provide an intuitive graphical interface to configure visual
properties of the chart. Integrating our Chart FX for Java Designer
with the NetBeans IDE was the natural step to take. By combining Chart
FX and NetBeans, developers are now able to create and configure the
charts graphically in the same environment they are using to code their
web applications.<br>
<br>
<h4>Software FX is presenting a technical demo for NetBeans Day at
CommunityOne. Can you tell us about it and what to expect?</h4>
The focus of JavaOne for us will be to showcase the latest version of
the product, Chart FX for Java 7. The five-minute demo that will be
shown
during NetBeans day basically portrays in a very condensed way, how
easy it is to integrate interactive, data-driven charts into existing
web application projects in NetBeans 6.x. That demo will basically show
a small part of what we'll have in the breakfast session on May 7th.<br>
<br>
<h4>What will be covered at the JavaOne Breakfast Session?</h4>
There are so many new things in ChartFX for Java 7 that we needed a
proper venue to let users see what this new version brings to the table.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Chart FX for Java 7 features a zero footprint, fully interactive UI
thanks to a patent-pending, framework-independent implementation of
AJAX. This is something we have not seen from any other vendor in the
Java market and we wanted to show some of the dynamic things you can do
with it, from contextual menus and toolbars to advanced business
dashboards that combine charts, gauges and maps for an interactive
experience. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
The idea is to let developers see how Chart FX for Java and the
NetBeans IDE can be combined in order to produce very powerful data
visualization applications with very little effort.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h4>Do you have other events planned for the Conference week?</h4>
Besides the technical demo on NetBeans day and the Breakfast session,
we will have our booth at the pavilion where we will be answering
questions and doing one-on-one demos to further showcase the advantages
of Chart FX for Java.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h4>What are your future development plans with NetBeans?</h4>
There are many things in discussion right now. While the Chart FX
plugin for NetBeans already makes things a lot easier for developers
working with charts, a couple of manual steps are still required. Our
ultimate goal is to achieve total seamless integration with NetBeans
through the plugin. Also, we plan to continue growing our partnership
with NetBeans by
providing more resources to our common users in the shape of
NetBeans-specific documentation, articles and samples.<br>
