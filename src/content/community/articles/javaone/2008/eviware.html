      <h1>NetBeans
Day 2008 Partner Spotlight</h1>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">The <a
 href="https://netbeans.org/community/partners/">NetBeans Partner
Program</a>
recognizes companies that add value to the
NetBeans Project by building plugins, endorsing NetBeans
as a development environment and/or application platform, and more. At <a
 href="https://netbeans.org/community/articles/javaone/2008/nb-day.html">NetBeans
Day 2008</a>, some of our partner companies will be on-hand to showcase
their technologies and to demonstrate the ways to extend and get the
most out of the NetBeans IDE! Here's a preview of what to expect.</span><br>

<h4>What is Eviware and how did the company become involved
with
NetBeans? </h4>
<a href="http://www.elixirtech.com/">
</a><span lang="en-US"><a href="http://eviware.com/">eviware</a> is a
Swedish open-source software producer making the Web Service Testing
tool
soapUI.</span> SoapUI is a standalone
tool, but creating a NetBeans Plugin was not a difficult choice.
Partly because we are NetBeans users ourselves and because we really
appreciate the level of inventiveness as well as the commitment to
open-source that is prevalent in the NetBeans community and wanted to
be part of this. The NetBeans OpenESB and Web Service teams have also
been great mentors in making the soapUI Plugin.<br>

      <h4>What is the soapUI
NetBeans plugin? What can developers do with it?</h4>
The <a href="http://www.soapui.org/netbeans/">soapUI
NetBeans Plugin</a> is a plugin for testing and simulating Web
Services. The plugin integrates into your Web Service development
and has the following functionality:<br>
      <br>
      <ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
        <li><span lang="en-US">Functional Testing</span> </li>
        <li><span lang="en-US">Load Testing</span> </li>
        <li><span lang="en-US">Web Service Simulation from WSDL</span> </li>
        <li><span lang="en-US">Extensive Standards Support</span> </li>
        <li><span lang="en-US">Web Service Monitoring and Recording</span>
        </li>
        <li><span lang="en-US">WSDL to Code in more than ten
environments</span> </li>
        <li><span lang="en-US">WS-Security</span> </li>
        <li><span lang="en-US">Reporting and Documentation</span> </li>
        <li><span lang="en-US">Fully Groovy Scriptable and Extensible</span></li>
      </ul>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><a

 style="border: 0px solid ; width: 435px; height: 261px;"></a><br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
The functionality makes an excellent companion to
Agile or Test Driven development. We have built soapUI with one goal
in mind, make Web Service Testing Fasy and Fun.<br>
<br>
<h4>Eviware will
present a demo about the plugin at NetBeans Day. What can attendees
expect to see or learn?</h4>
Since we are
doing a very short presentation we will focus on showing how
easy it is to simulate Web Services in soapUI.<br>
<br>
<h4>Do you have other
events at JavaOne?</h4>
No,
but we will be happy to give attendees in-depth demos at our JavaOne
booth.
Come to booth 425 in SOA Village to see what more the soapUI plugin
can do for you.
<br>
<br>
<h4>What's the roadmap for your partnership with
NetBeans?
</h4>
The soapUI Plug in will be regularly updated during
the year. Look for a new release during the summer. soapUI integrates
well with Web Service Testing and OpenESB and will be in the NetBeans
Update Center starting with NetBeans 6.1. We will be looking into how
we can further improve NetBeans integration and make the tool work
seamlessly with the NetBeans experience. We will be listening to the
input given by the Community after 6.1 as well as the NetBeans Teams
and then use their input and then try making soapUI better.<br>
