      <h1>NetBeans
Day 2008 Partner Spotlight</h1>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">The <a
 href="https://netbeans.org/community/partners/">NetBeans Partner
Program</a>
recognizes companies that add value to the
NetBeans Project by building plugins, endorsing NetBeans
as a development environment and/or application platform, and more. At <a
 href="https://netbeans.org/community/articles/javaone/2008/nb-day.html">NetBeans
Day 2008</a>, some of our partner companies will be on-hand to showcase
their technologies and to demonstrate the ways to extend and get the
most out of the NetBeans IDE! Here's a preview of what to expect.</span><br>

<h4>What is dotFX? </h4>
<a href="http://www.elixirtech.com/">
</a><span lang="en-US"></span><a href="http://www.dotfx.com/">dotFX</a>
is in the business of “Live software”. We provide a set of essential
but powerful runtime services to software. These include click-to-run
deployment, incremental install and update, security, online and
offline execution modes, and the ability to run any part of the
application on any local or remote device. All of these features are
available without code modification. Other services, such as customer
support, PKI, licensing and billing, are available as paid options. <br>
<br>
dotFX and JavaFX together make a compelling RIA platform. dotFX handles
JavaFX delivery at the client, transparent, incremental updates,
client-server communication and supplemental runtime security services.
dotFX applications share a single set of JavaFX libraries, so downloads
are fast. <br>
<br>
dotFX combines all the advantages of Web deployment with the power of
real client software. Web-oriented business models such as SaaS
delivery and billing, metering and monitoring are now available to
fully functional client applications. <br>
<br>
dotFX also enables entirely new deployment modes such as desktop
beachheads into which new features (and, in fact, entirely new
applications) can be published over time, and media/player bundles
that eliminate compatibility problems and greatly facilitate the
problem of&nbsp; rights management. The capabilities of dotFX are
therefore a distinct superset of Web and desktop.<br>
<br>
<h4>How did the company become involved with NetBeans?</h4>
Most of the dotFX development team uses NetBeans as their IDE and we
maintain a good relationship with members of the NetBeans Engineering
and Marketing teams. <br>
<br>
From a technical perspective, our involvement with
NetBeans started when we prototyped what we internally call “NetBeans
Live” to demonstrate that you can take one of the most robust Java
applications, and place it on the framework, enabling it as a networked
application with all the primary and second order benefits and with
virtually no code modification. The area of code modification we
decided to showcase for the prototype was that of the native startup
code. With the framework, we were able to turn this into a small amount
of Java code.<br>
<br>

 style="border: 0px solid ; width: 344px; height: 240px;" align="right"
 hspace="5" vspace="5"></a>What's the current status of NetBeans Live?</h4>
NetBeans Live is currently just a prototype. If the NetBeans team and
the Java community is interested in exploring this application further,
we look forward to that step.<br>
<br>
NetBeans Live is one complete build delivered incrementally over dotFX.
As such there is only one version that is a super set. Only what is
used is downloaded, and it is always the latest. Previous versions, as
opposed to the latest, could be started seamlessly by having multiple
links. Between versions this should provide both roll back but more
importantly easy roll forward.<br>
<br>
<h4>Can you tell us about what to expect from dotFX at NetBeans
Day? </h4>
Yes, we have three activities planned:<br>
<br>
<ul style="margin-left: 50px;">
  <li>A dotFX demo booth where we will
demonstrate click-to-run technologies of all sorts, for example, the
NetBeans plugin and NetBeans Live. In addition, we will show Java
applications from open-source that other developers wrote, and we took
the code, dropped it into ServerFX without code modification. </li>
  <li>A
10-minute Lightening Speech presented by Mark Chen, our CTO.
(The
speech is currently scheduled for when James Gosling is the MC.) </li>
  <li>A 5-minute video of our Netbeans plugin. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Do you have other events planned for JavaOne? </h4>
Developers can find us at Booth 3 at CommunityOne, and at Booth 737 at
JavaOne.<br>
<br>
<h4>What are your future development plans with NetBeans?</h4>
Already we have the ClientFX and ServerFX Services plug-in for
NetBeans. Later we plan to include InstallFX which allows developers to
package applications in dotFX technology. InstallFX produces software
installers that are dotFX enabled out of the box. As such applications
can install and update the application as live contact, incrementally
and can take of both client and server side execution.<br>
