<p>You asked for it and here it is!

<p>In less than two months, we'll be having our first NetBeans mega event. On Tuesday, June 29, 2004,
the NetBeans team is hosting a free companion event to JavaOne in San Francisco, California that
will feature the NetBeans Project including a preview of the latest release, a look inside
NetBeans Technology and will also feature key NetBeans Partners.

<p>The keynote will feature James Gosling talking about Tools and the future. And if you've heard
James speak, you know there'll be some great surprises. This is not to be missed!
