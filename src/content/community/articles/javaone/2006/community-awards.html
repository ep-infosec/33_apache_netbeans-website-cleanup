<h1>NetBeans Community Awards 2006</h1>

<p>There are many dedicated people in the NetBeans Community - we'd like to
recognize them and say thank you for all they've done for NetBeans. Whether
their contributions have come in the form of evangelizing, contributing code
or bug fixes, building modules, writing articles, localizations, or
something else entirely, it's time to acknowledge their efforts.  

<p>You can vote for up to 4 nominees.  Note that Sun employees are not
eligible for the Community Awards, so some employees that were nominated do
not appear in the list below.

<p><b>The winners of the NetBeans Community Awards 2006 are: </b></p>
  <ul>
  <li>David Strupl</li>
  <li>Ram√≥n Ramos</li>
  <li>Wade Chandler</li>
  <li>Tom Wheeler</li>
</ul>

<p>Congratulations! </p>
