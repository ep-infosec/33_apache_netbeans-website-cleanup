<H1>NetBeans Software Day 2006 -- Empowering Developers Worldwide</H1>

<div class="articledate" style="margin-left:0px;">By Ruth Kusterer, originally published on java.sun.com,
May 15, 2006</div>

<P>It's like hitting the switch in a power station. The 12-city
<a href="https://netbeans.org/community/articles/worldtour/">NetBeans IDE World Tour</a> is spreading like wildfire from Toronto to
Brasilia, from Tokyo to Johannesburg, and back to San Francisco.
Millions of Java technology developers already plug into NetBeans IDE
5.0, and NetBeans IDE 5.5 is on its way to empower even more.
Registration numbers for NetBeans Software Day rose to new heights:
On Monday, May 15, 2006, about 1000 developers squeezed into one of
the bigger halls in San Francisco's Argent Hotel -- almost twice as
many as last year. What an electrifying year for the NetBeans
community.
</P>

<P>NetBeans Software day at the <a href="https://netbeans.org/community/articles/javaone/2006/nb-day.html">JavaOne(SM) 2006</a> conference began
with Tim Cramer's opening keynote. Now senior director of Java Tools
at Sun, Cramer announced the Subversion support module that will be
included in the final release of the highly anticipated <A HREF="https://netbeans.org/community/releases/55/index.html">NetBeans IDE 5.5 release</a>. The latest beta is already a popular download among
developers, with improved versioning control and many more extended
Java enterprise, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), and Unified
Modeling Language (UML) features-- all right out of the box and
free.
</P>

<P>Cramer revealed that the successful launches of NetBeans IDE 5.0
and 5.5 beta have attracted over 100 <a href="https://netbeans.org/community/partners/index.html">commercial and community partners</a> this year, and more are joining each week. Among them are
Sprint, a global provider of communication services; InsiTech, a
contributor of ultra-thin rich-client Java interfaces; Lattix Inc.,
the source of the Lightweight Dependency Models plug-in; Ricoh
Company Ltd., one of the leading global manufacturers of office
automation equipment; Apache Maven, with its project management and
comprehension tool; and SavaJe, the developer of the most advanced
Java technology-based mobile operating platform. And just today,
JBoss and AMD have joined, too.
</P>

<P>Cramer then handed the microphone to Jonathan Schwartz, the new
president and chief executive officer of Sun Microsystems, succeeding
the current chairman of the board of directors, Scott McNealy.
Schwartz himself introduced Rich Green, who recently returned to Sun
as chief of the software group and consequently had to bear some of
Schwartz's jokes. On a more serious note, Schwartz then pointed out
the importance of good tools, because his experience showed that
working with good tools increases the engineers' working morale
significantly. One pretty clear example for such a tool, Sprint's
NetBeans IDE-based Mobility IDE, was demonstrated live.

<P>But when Click and Hack, the Type-It Brothers, also known as
Joshua Bloch and Neal Gafter, showed up onstage with a bunch of
optical illusions, the audience was a little puzzled. Bloch is the
chief Java architect at Google and author of the Jolt Award-winning
book, <I>Effective Java</I>. He is co-author of <I>JavaPuzzlers:
Traps, Pitfalls, and Corner Cases</I>, together with his fellow
Google employee Neal Gafter, a software engineer and Java evangelist.
</P>
<P>Their presentation's connection to NetBeans Software Day soon
became clear when they proceeded to show code illusions: pieces of
code that seemed straightforward enough but that did not behave as
expected. What if the IDE could not only detect these common and
hard-to-notice errors for you but also fix them? Enter Tom Ball with
Jackpot, NetBeans IDE's new secret weapon. The audience broke into
applause at his presentation of Jackpot, which can be described as a
very advanced FindBugs plus Refactoring on steroids. The Jackpot
module is available for testing on the beta update center.

<P>Before the in-depth sessions started, Bob Brewin quickly talked
about Sun's tools strategy and the future of the four free IDEs --
Sun Java Studio Creator (JSC), Sun Java Studio Enterprise (JSE),
NetBeans IDE, and Sun Studio.
</P>
<P>Do you mainly create rich web applications? Let JSC help you. Do
you specialize in SOA and enterprise applications? Try JSE. Do you
live on the leading edge? Try NetBeans IDE daily builds. Or are you
focusing on C/C++ development on the Solaris Operating Environment
and Linux operating system? Go with Sun Studio. These features will
become available over the course of this year in one standard
distribution of the NetBeans IDE. This process is starting now with
version 5.5 and the Enterprise Pack, and it will continue with the
release of the new native C/C++ support.
</P>

<P>Apart from development for the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition
(Java EE) 5, the sessions that followed addressed the next generation
of GUI building, for example, Project Matisse; the advantages of
building rich client applications on the NetBeans platform; as well
as state-of-the-art mobile application development with NetBeans
Mobility Pack and the new SavaJe CDC pack. For each of these topics,
NetBeans software engineers and technology evangelists had prepared
live feature demonstrations for the attendees.
</P>
<P>The sessions were divided in two tracks: Track A gave an
exhaustive overview of SOA, enterprise, and mobile application
development, as well as interoperability of enterprise features
(Project Tango). Track B zoomed in on building user interfaces and
client applications, covering development tools for Java EE and Java
Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE), as well as for the NetBeans
platform and the new Realtime Java Plug-in. The speakers also
answered burning questions from the audience.

<P>In the afternoon, the attendees reassembled for the closing
keynote by &quot;the father of Java,&quot; James Gosling. Gosling has
initiated the Jackpot project and has worked on the Real-Time
Specification for Java (RTSJ). The current chief technology officer
of Sun's Developer Products group had the honor of awarding four
members of the NetBeans community with a certificate and a Sun Ultra
20 workstation, in recognition of their outstanding contributions to
the ongoing project. Congratulations to Wade Chandler, Ramon Ramos,
David Strupl, and Tom Wheeler!

<P>This day went by much too soon. But attendees took home more than
just the impressions of the <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/roumen?entry=netbeans_worldtour_movie">energetic music clip featuring shots of
developers from all the world tour locations</a>. NetBeans Software Day
was an excellent opportunity for everyone to tap into the collective
brainpower of Java technology luminaries and fellow developers. And
award winners weren't the only ones to go home with a little
something extra in their conference backpacks: The first 400
attendees through the door received a free copy of the new <I>NetBeans
IDE Field Guide</I> (second edition) and a 256 MB USB drive.
