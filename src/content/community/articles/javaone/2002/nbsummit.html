<p>We are putting together a NetBeans Summit Meeting.
The Summit will start at 6pm and go for about two hours. You
will have a chance to talk to the developers of NetBeans that you probably only know
from the mailing lists or you can talk to companies building applications
and plugins on NetBeans.  <i>You do not need to be attending JavaOne to
attend this NetBeans meeting.</i>
<p>You can also meet us at the NetBeans booth at 5:40
and go to the conference room with us.
