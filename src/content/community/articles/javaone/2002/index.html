<h1>NetBeans at JavaONE 2002</h1>
As most of you probably know, this year's JavaONE took place in the
Moscone Center in San Francisco.  It went from March the 25th till the
29th, and it was a one big ride for NetBeans!
<p>
We had eleven people from NetBeans at the conference.  Tim
Boudreau, Ian Formanek, and I organized the booths (we had more
than one!) and were also responsible for making sure that NetBeans was
heard about out there. Martin Matula (our MDR expert), Jiri
Mzourek (UI expert), Jiri Kovalsky and Martin Entlicher (CVS experts),
Martin Ryzl (J2ME expert), Petr Kuzel (XML and JINI), David Strupl (Core
expert) and of course Jesse Glick (our architecture and overall Java
guru) were also there.  Many of these guys led BOFs and sessions.  See
the complete list of NetBeans BOFs and Sessions.
</p>
<p>
As I already mentioned, we had two booths.  One was the NetBeans IDE
booth.  It consisted of two machines running NetBeans on Windows and
Linux.  This booth was a regular 5x5 booth and was located right
beside the Forte for Java booth in what we called the NetBeans
Pavilion.
</p>
<p>
The NetBeans Pavilion was an area on the showfloor where there was a
high concentration of booths with the "Built on NetBeans" sign.  Every
partner that was showing a product that plugged into NetBeans had a big
yellow sign attached to their booth which said "Built on NetBeans".  So
the NetBeans Pavilion had over 15 booths with the yellow sign.  Of
course
there were other companies on the showfloor scattered around who had the
sign so when you walked around you saw the "Built on NetBeans" yellow
signs everywhere!
</p>
<p>
Since NetBeans has a lot of partners, we also setup a booth that we
called the NetBeans Partner booth.  It was a 10x10 booth where eight
additional partners took turns each day showing their product on
top of NetBeans.  Also at this booth, we gave away NetBeans
t-shirts, red flashing NetBeans buttons and NetBeans brochures.
</p>
<p>
One of the highlights of the conference was the NetBeans Summit which
took place on Wednesday the 27th.  We got a room in the W-hotel and
invited people from the NetBeans community to talk about NetBeans.  The
evening started with people from NetBeans giving out short presentations
about various aspects of NetBeans, and the event ended with everyone in
the room talking to each other until the hotel staff had to ask us to
leave long after the closing hours.
</p>
<p>
There were also other very bright moments for NetBeans.  Each day
of JavaONE begins with a keynote.  NetBeans was mentioned in 3
out of the 4 keynotes!  First by James Gosling, who is a great fan of
NetBeans and who also came to the NetBeans summit, when showing the Ace
demo
done by Sun Labs.  The second time, NetBeans was mentioned by Rob
Gingell when announcing that the prior night, NetBeans won the JavaWorld
Editor's choice award.  And on the third day, NetBeans was mentioned
when Peter Young, VP of Forte Tools showed the Micro Edition demo and
the Micro Edition to Enterprise Edition end-to-end demo - web service on
mobile phone.
</p>
<p>
All of the above combined gave NetBeans tremendous exposure and, on top
of 
that, showed that NetBeans is a product that is being used in real
life by many industry leaders.  Thanks to everyone, who helped us at the
booths, and if you are one of the people who were at the Summit or came
to our booth, please send us your feedback.
