<h1>NetBeans Poll: Six Predictions for NetBeans in 2007</h1>
What does 2007 hold for NetBeans and Java? 
We have asked six NetBeans experts to look ahead 
and make predictions for 2007. 
Our subjects--two Evangelists, an Architect, an Editor, a Writer 
and a Community Manager--have different ideas on what they think 
is coming up on the horizon this year for NetBeans and the field of Java. 
<br>
<br>
Read the predictions and then vote on the forecast you most agree with!

 <h4>Gregg Sporar, NetBeans Evangelist</h4>
 <br>
EJB3 and the Java Persistence API will gain even more momentum in 2007.<br>
<br>
There are two things that will help drive this. First, more and more of
the application servers will release versions that are compatible with
Java EE 5. Second, the tools will continue to improve. To take just one
example: as tool support for the Seam framework continues to improve,
that will drive Seam adoption which in turn will help drive EJB3
adoption.

 <h4>Jaroslav "Yarda" Tulach, NetBeans Architect</h4>
 <br>
The biggest change
in the Java world last year, and maybe also the IT market, was
Java going open-source. I saw the momentum-there were
thousands of people waiting for this to happen. The open-sourcing is
likely to continue next year and I am really eager to see the outcome. <br>
<br>
I expect that Java will be adopted by the Linux community and we
will see a lot of Linux applications written in Java. I hope Java will
be part of standard Linux distributions. I am convinced that the
desktop integration of Java will get much better due to contribution of
Linux communities. Java adoption is going to rise in unimaginable ways.
I really cannot expect anything else more important for 2007 in the IT
world than the results of open-sourcing Java.&nbsp;

 <h4>Bruno Souza, NetBeans Community Manager</h4>
 <br>
2007 will be a year that Java and Sun will do a large leap in community
participation. <br>
<br>
Last year, Sun released many of its software solutions
as open-source. We not only saw the announcement of the full Java
platform (JME, JSE and JEE) to become open-source under the most
recognized license, but also we had the final versions of Java SE 6 and
Java EE 5, and both included many technologies and ideas that were born
on the open-source community. All that activity will bring a strong
positive reflection on the relationship between Sun and the developer
community in 2007. Instead of investing efforts to donate code, Sun
will invest in becoming a strong participant in the
worldwide open-source community.

style="width: 100px; height: 125px;" align="left" hspace="5">
<h4>Geertjan Wielenga, NetBeans Writer</h4>
<br>
Scripting support in NetBeans is going to open the IDE to a whole
bunch of new communities.

 <h4>Roman Strobl, NetBeans Evangelist</h4>
 <br>
NetBeans will again
gain market share in year 2007. <br>
<br>
NetBeans adoption has been accelerating during last two years and I predict that
this trend will continue. The main reason for increased adoption will be
features introduced in NetBeans 6.0 which will focus on increasing developer
productivity. There will be many innovative features for desktop Java,
support for scripting languages and much more.

 <h4>Leonardo Galv√§o, Editor-in-Chief, NetBeans Magazine</h4>
<br>
With the
open-sourcing of Sun's Java SE implementation, Java
desktop APIs will increase in quality, performance and tool support. <br>
<br>
Community collaboration will bring more eyes and hands around the core Java APIs.
This will help solve deficiencies found in less-used but highly valued Java
technologies such as Swing. <br><br>
