          <td style="vertical-align: top;">Tim Boudreau is a noted
            technology consultant, evangelist and author. While perhaps
            most broadly known for his leadership on Sun Microsystems’
            NetBeans, those who’ve worked with Tim remark most on his
            technical chops, passion for a great challenge and rare gift
            of great communication. And, as a former troubadour, he’s
            pretty tough when it comes to bad 70s rock lyrics too. A
            real renaissance programmer.<br>

            Hibernate and databases", which showcases NetBeans. My
            philosophy is that my best successes occur when I assist
            others to be successful. I have found this is especially
            true in the NetBeans community, where I continue to learn so
            much through service. <br>

          <td style="vertical-align: top;">I am Java software developer
            living in Leipzig, Germany. For years I am used to be an
            Eclipse user, but since 2011 I use NetBeans exclusively at
            work. Why? Because it works. Yes, some neat and handy
            features from other IDEs are still missing, but that was my
            reason to improve this situation and to start contributing.
            I am the author of several freely available NetBeans
            plugins, I contribute patches to NetBeans IDE/Platform and I
            am an active member of the NetCAT program. All this to make
            NetBeans even better.<br>
            <br>
            I am honored for the nomination. Thank you for your trust.<br>
