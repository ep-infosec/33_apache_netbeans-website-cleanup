<h2>About Refactoring</h2>

<P>Let's face it: all code will have to evolve and be modified. Software of any
sophistication just isn't destined to harden. New styles and practices of
development are advocated by the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Software Manifesto</a>
and the iterative deployment processes of
<a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgramming">extreme programming</a>
to keep software flexible and more useful over time. The latest articles
from Robert C. Martin highlight the importance of
<a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/Continuous_Care.pdf">continuous care</a>,
showing that the evolution of code -- through a process of refactoring -- is
more important than initial design.

<P>All of these practitioners advocate Refactoring as a primary discipline,
to be applied to code bases within each iteration. Refactoring isn't a fad:
it's a fundamental way to keep your code flexible and clean, as you keep
learning about what the actual design needs are.

<P>Using the methodology of Refactoring makes change <i>manageable</i> -
using the RefactorIT tool makes change <i>easy</i>.

<P>What RefactorIT Does</FONT>

<P>RefactorIT is a NetBeans module that performs common refactoring
operations safely and automatically. RefactorIT adds new menu items, such as
Rename, Where Used or Extract Method, to IDE-s context menus.

<P><IMG SRC="../../images_www/refactorIT_snapshot.jpg">
<BR CLEAR><B>Figure 1</B>: Snapshot of RefactorIT in action with NetBeans.

<P>With RefactorIT you can safely select any item and rename it, search for
its usages or its dependencies. Extract a piece of code into a separate
method. Move a class to a different package, encapsulate field to be
accessed by getter and setter methods, turn constructor usages into factory
method, explore classes hierarchy, extract a superclass or superinterface
out of existing class, save and compare snapshots of API, find where
exception is caught, track your TODO/FIXME comments, find not used fields
and methods, see source code metrics, quickly navigate the source code or
search for source code constructs like 'search for methods returning
java.io.File'.

<P>RefactorIT's Underlying Technology</FONT>

<P>Basic functionality is not the only criteria for a refactoring tool to be
useful and efficient. The tool must also meet certain requirements, among
them:
<DL>
<DT><B>Accuracy</B></DT>
<DD>Automatic refactorings must retain the original behavior of the code as
fully as possible, and analysis tools must provide accurate information
about the code.  This is clearly the most basic requirement for any
refactoring tool.</DD>

<DT><B>Speed</B></DT>
<DD>Analysis and transformations performed by a refactoring tool are very
sophisticated, especially for large projects with hundreds of source files.
If those processes are not well optimized, they can be quite time consuming.
Naturally, a refactoring tool which takes a long time to perform its tasks
will not be widely used.</DD>

<DT><B>Integration with an IDE</B></DT>
<DD>Research suggests that developers are less likely to use a standalone
refactoring tool &#150; whether it's powerful or not &#150; than one
integrated with their development environment. The ability to invoke actions
directly from the development environment is a significant feature to many
users. A flexible integration to IDE(s) is a high priority of RefactorIT,
but one which also requires that the target IDE has an extensible plug-in
architecture.</DD>
</DL>

<P>Architecture of RefactorIT</FONT>

<P>The objectives outlined above had a direct bearing on the architectural
design of RefactorIT &#151; in fact the goal was to build a tool which can
accurately and quickly perform refactorings and analysis functions invoked
from various places within the IDE.

<P><FONT CLASS="default">

</TR>
<TR>
  <TD ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Figure 2</B>: Architectural depiction of RefactorIT working with NetBeans to automate refactoring code.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>The resulting architecture can be roughly divided into distinct parts as
follows:

<UL>
<LI>project loader</LI>
<LI>source parser</LI>
<LI>classfile loader</LI>
<LI>general user interface</LI>
<LI>integration to IDE</LI>
<LI>refactoring module framework</LI>
</UL>

<P>The project loader handles the loading (or reloading) of the project upon
the user's invocation of a refactoring or analysis function. When first run,
the project loader builds a class model from the set of source and class
files. In addition, it constructs an abstract syntax tree (AST) from the
parsed source. The AST stores information about the source files &#150;
below the method level &#150; and links type definitions with their
references throughout the code. This is the heart of
RefactorIT.<P>RefactorIT passes the AST to the refactoring or analyzing
component specified by the user. From there, the tree is analyzed and
manipulated, and finally RefactorIT displays the query results or writes the
refactored sources to their corresponding files.

<P>To optimize performance, RefactorIT caches the class model and syntax
tree of the project. Consequently, for large projects, the first run only of
a refactoring or analysis function goes relatively slowly as the class model
and syntax trees is built. Subsequent runs take much less time because the
project class model is already constructed and only has to be updated in
places where the user has changed code.<P>RefactorIT has a pluggable module
architecture &#150; in fact all refactorings are implemented in different
modules. This enables developers to add experimental modules to RefactorIT
without worrying about compatibility &#151; only the modules which are fully
tested are bundled with the installer.

<P>RefactorIT in Practice</FONT>

<P>Let's say, we have a calculation caching mechanism. In the start we build
up calculation results that we need to store and later query this cache to
save time. We have created our own data structure MultiValueMap for storing
these caches.

<P>This structure needs to be fast, while we are building it and memory
efficient, when we store it. Currently it is only fast and not memory
efficient.

<P>We have found out we could 'compact' the map, but in its compact form the
storing operations would be slower.

<P>So what we need to do is to call compact on right items and at the right
time.

<P>RefactorIT Walkthrough</FONT>
<OL>
<LI>We are using a RefactorIT feature 'Structure Search' to find places
where MultiValueMap is used as field:

<BR><img src="../../images_www/refactorIT_wt1.png" VSPACE="8" HSPACE="10"><P></LI>

<LI>We click the results through and hide the results of short lived
objects, because we do not need to compact them:

<BR><img src="../../images_www/refactorIT_wt2.png" VSPACE="8" HSPACE="10"><P></LI>

<LI>From remaining results we choose 'Where Used' on the field to find out
when the map construction has ended. There we add a call to 'compact()'
method:

<BR><img src="../../images_www/refactorIT_wt3.png" VSPACE="8" HSPACE="10"><P></LI>

<LI>When going through the list we choose 'Hide' for items we have done so
the remaining search results serve as a TODO list. - Notice that line
numbers of search results are recalculated after the code changes.</LI>
</OL>

<P>Conclusion</FONT>

<P>RefactorIT provides a wide range of refactoring and analysis functions
which enable developers of Java technology to quickly and successfully
restructure program source - improving its design, evolution, and reuse
potential.<P>NetBeans was chosen to be the primary integration platform for
RefactorIT because it is the home of worldwide innovation in Java Tools.
RefactorIT, through its tight integration with NetBeans, makes the
refactoring process easier, faster, and more efficient.
