        <h1>End of Year Message 2011</h1>

        <p>With the end of the year quickly approaching, the NetBeans 
            Team would like to thank the NetBeans community for its support 
            over the past year. This has been a milestone year for NetBeans where 
            we've hit the 1,000,000 active user mark. We've also released NetBeans 
            IDE 7.0 and NetBeans IDE 7.0.1, and underpinned the success of many other projects.

        <p>We are currently putting the finishing touches on our current release, NetBeans IDE 7.1. 
            Given the holidays and festivities being near, we are going to hold off on 
            releasing NetBeans IDE 7.1 until early next year, when it will have maximum impact.

        <p>Again, we thank all of you for your encouragement and support, and wish you 
            and yours happy holidays and a great New Year.

        <p><i>The NetBeans Team</i>
