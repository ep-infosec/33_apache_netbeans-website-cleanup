  <title>NetBeans IDE at JUG Cologne IDE Shootout - The Aftermath</title>

<h1>Java and Developers are Winners of IDE Shootout</h1>
<span style="font-style: italic;">July 12, 2007</span><br>
<br>
On a recent July evening in Cologne, Germany, more than 70 developers
gathered to witness an unprecedented event: four rival IDEs—NetBeans,
Eclipse, Oracle and JetBrains—together on one stage. The IDE shootout,
the first of its kind, was hosted by JUG Cologne.<br>
<br>
Representatives from each IDE were given 30 minutes to make a
presentation about the merits of their product. Roman Strobl, the first
evangelist to take the stage, spoke on behalf of NetBeans.<br>
<br>
Strobl launched his talk with an attention-grabbing demo of the
platform-based application <a href="http://bluemarine.tidalwave.it/">blueMarine</a>,
a digital photo management
system built on the NetBeans Platform by developer Fabrizio Giudici.
Using the integration of blueMarine
and NASA's <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/javase/worldwind/">World
Wind Component</a> to
show 3D images of the Alps and Cologne, Strobl explained that creating
similar applications was possible by reusing
existing Swing components.<br>
<br>
The NetBeans segment continued with quick overviews of the top five
features of the IDE: Matisse, Profiler, Java EE 5, Mobility and Ruby. A
demo of Matisse highlighted its support for databinding and Swing
application framework, while the NetBeans Profiler effectively zeroed
in on a memory leak introduced into an application. Strobl was also
able to give the audience a preview of improvements to the NetBeans 6.0
Editor with a look at some of its intelligent editing features.<br>

Wayne Beaton and Frank Nimphius proceeded Strobl with presentations for
Eclipse and Oracle, respectively; The St. Petersburg team of Maxim
Shafirov, Mike Aizatsky, and Ann Oreshnikova, speaking for JetBrains,
were the final
presenters. The individual IDE demos were
followed by an hour-long discussion between evangelists and audience
members. <br>
<br>
<a
 href="https://netbeans.org/community/articles/jugcologne-shootout.html">As
planned</a> by event moderator and organizer, JUG Cologne leader
Michael
Hutterman, there was no declared winner among the IDEs.&nbsp; In a
post-event report, Hutterman noted that the event achieved its goal—a
non-competitive discussion among the top IDEs.<br>
<br>
The clear winner, he wrote, was the Java community.<br>
