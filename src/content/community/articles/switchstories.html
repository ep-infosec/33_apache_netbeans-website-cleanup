<h1>Have You Made the Switch to NetBeans?</h1>
&nbsp; <br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;An IDE should work with you, not
against you....&#8221;</span><br>
<br>
<br>
It's the type of reaction normally reserved for rock stars by screaming
teenage fans, or displayed by ardent soccer aficionados cheering on
their favorite teams, but how many IDEs can claim the distinction of
compelling developers to want to lose their t-shirts in joy (rather
than frustration)? NetBeans can, after <a
 href="https://netbeans.org/switch/realstories.html">Balmeyer</a>, a
French developer
recently submitted a testimonial about his experience working with the
NetBeans 5.5 IDE. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;I just tried NetBeans 5.5 under
Linux, plus the Visual Web Pack, and I
am breathless. I used Eclipse for a long time, and one day, I was
curious and gave NetBeans 5.0 a try, but I still wasn't completely
convinced. Until now. NetBeans 5.5 is incredible! I want to tear off my
T-shirt in joy!...&#8221;</span><br>
<br>
Generally, developers prefer to keep their shirts on&#8212;we think&#8212;but many
have been just as effusive as Balmeyer in recounting their experience
working with the NetBeans IDE. From Mali to Japan, France to Brazil,
the stories have poured in from users who have discovered (or
rediscovered) NetBeans and have made the switch from other IDEs.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;...after using JBuilder and Eclipse
we definitively switched to
NetBeans since it offers for free the most impressive and efficient
Java development environment available in 2006 and 2007. With
invaluable plug-ins and features like the Matisse GUI design tools and
the integrated profile, it outperforms the Java IDE competition
today...&#8221;</span><br>
<br>
Testimonials from working developers, Java instructors and students
since the release of NetBeans 5.0 and the upgrade to NetBeans 5.5 have
shared a similar theme: enthusiasm for new tools added to the IDE and
improvements to previous features. Users have raved about tools such as
Matisse GUI builder, the Visual Web Pack and the NetBeans Profiler.
They've cited
the IDE's ease of installation, its support for J2EE and cross-platform
development, access to tutorials and plug-ins, that it saves time and
is available at no charge, and more.<br>
<br>
The testimonials have also been evenly divided between newcomers to the
NetBeans IDE and users who turned to other IDEs after they found older
versions of NetBeans lacking. The Eclipse user
interested in Enterprise development and who finally struck gold with
NetBeans 5.5 after repeated tries with previous versions. The student
searching for an IDE for a Java programming class and after an easy
installation declared NetBeans his IDE of choice. A developer looking
for an IDE that would give him Facelet support. A serial IDE
user&#8212;Visual Age, Rational Suite, Eclipse and more&#8212;converting after
discovering NetBeans's Profiler.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, these "Switch Stories" bolster what recent <a
 href="https://netbeans.org/community/articles/infoworld-award.html">reviews
and awards</a> have been saying about the NetBeans IDE: that it has
become a significant contender in the field of IDEs.<br>
