<h1>NetBeans Community Docs Program Reaches Milestone:<br />200 Contributions (and Counting!)</h1>

<div class="callout">
<q>There are a lot of people in the community who really want to help others learn.</q>
</div>

<p class="lead">An important milestone for the NetBeans Community Docs program was reached on
August 7, 2008 when it received its 200th contribution. The program, managed by NetBeans
documentation writer and blogger James Branam, has managed to attract more than
80 NetBeans users and enthusiasts to provide tutorials, screencasts, and other
learning materials for the purpose of helping to inspire and support the NetBeans
user community. Says Branam, <q>You might say it's documentation <em>by</em> the
community <em>for</em> the community.</q></p>

<div class="photobox">

</div>

<p>The Community Docs program started a year and a half ago and has grown
tremendously. <q>Response to the program has been nothing less than overwhelming,</q>
says Branam. <q>There are a lot of people in the community who really want to help
others learn.</q></p>

<p>In addtion to the tutorials and screencasts mentioned above, contributors also
provide FAQs and technical articles, as well as tips and tricks for use by other
community members. It also serves as a resource for documentation on the official
<a href="https://netbeans.org/">netbeans.org</a> web site, where contributions
from the program have been included in the learning trails. In some cases,
community-contributed docs have been turned into official NetBeans documentation.</p>

<p>With  (at last count) 82 active contributors, some have obviously contributed
more than once, and one person has contributed more than ten times. <q>The rate of
returning contributors indicates that contributors are satisfied by the way their
contributions are being showcased to the rest of the community,</q> says Branam, who
has managed the program since its inception.</p>

<h2>Upward Trend in Community Participation</h2>

<q>It is our job to ensure that each contributor gets the proper recognition for
their contribution.</q>
</div>

<p>In addition to maintaining the program, Branam pores over NetBeans user blogs
and similar sites, taking note of entries that might qualify as contributions to
the pool of NetBeans knowlege. He often solicits these users to contribute their
know-how to the program by submitting an article. He also works closely with Varun
Nischal, the contribution coordinator, and Amit Kumar Saha, the content manager
for the program. Both assist Branam in maintaining the level of content quality
in submitted documentation.</p>

<p>Both Saha (who has recently been employed by Sun Microsystems) and Nischal blog
regularly. Nischal has been particularly active as contributor, also re-designing
the wiki page and the archives. In addition, he is the most frequent blogger about
the program, according to Branam.</p>

<p><q>It is our job to ensure that each contributor gets the proper recognition for
their contribution.</q> Branam adds, <q>My colleagues Amit and Varun have been very
important in sustaining the momentum of the program.</q></p>

</div>

<p>That the program has momentum is clear from the accompanying chart, showing a
mostly consistent upward trend since the program began. If Branam's projections
hold true, August will mark the program's second record month in a row. (At the
time of this writing, Community Docs had already received its 208th contribution.)</p>

<p>In addition, the program has just launched an official weekly newsletter.
It serves to highlight the most recent contributed docs, presents the topmost
contributor of the week, and reports news of interest to the docs community. Any
articles that are provided by Dream Team members are pointed out, and one item is
chosen for special mention in the Spotlight of the Week.</p>

<p>In addition, the program currently has its own blog, mailing list, and wiki
  (see <q>Further Reading</q> below). Plans are being made for a NetBeans plugin to aid in the
formatting and creation of various kinds docs to help contributors to the program
achieve a certain level of quality and consistency. Also, plans are being laid for
an evangelism program aimed at encouraging even more contributions.</p>
