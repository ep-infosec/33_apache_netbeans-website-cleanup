<h1>NetBeans IDE Strikes Twice at Jolt Awards</h1>
<i>March 5, 2008</i><br>
<br>
<br>
The NetBeans IDE is a two-time Jolt Award winner! <br>
<br>
The NetBeans IDE 6.0 beat out five other finalists to nab the "Best
Development Environment" honor at the <a
 href="http://www.joltawards.com/press/030608.htm">18th Annual Jolt Product Excellence
Awards</a> gala ceremony held at the SD West Conference in Santa Clara,
California.<br>
<br>
Last night's presentation marks the second year in a row that the
NetBeans IDE has won the development environment group. (<a
 href="https://netbeans.org/community/articles/jolt2007.html">Version
5.5 won the previous year</a>.) NetBeans also earned repeat
“Productivity Awards” in two categories: Web Development Tool and
Mobility Development Tool (with Sun Java Wireless Toolkit 2.5.2).<br>
<br>
The NetBeans IDE that impressed Jolt judges this year is a sleeker and
more enhanced tool than its predecessor. After last year's win, the IDE
underwent a major overhaul and acquired a faster and smarter editor,
support for dynamic languages such as Ruby, a new Visual Game Designer,
integrated profiling, and many more features. NetBeans 6.0 was released
in December 2007.<br>
<br>
Accepting the Jolt awards for NetBeans, Senior Director of Engineering
Octavian Tanase thanked the NetBeans community, engineering teams and
partner companies for the collective effort that has transformed the
IDE into the powerful and feature-rich tool that continues to impress
industry experts and developers worldwide. <br>
<br>
Jolt awards celebrate the most innovative, trend-making,
ahead-of-the-curve products in the software industry.<br>
<br>
Congratulations to the NetBeans community!
