<h1>An Interview with Adam Myatt, Author of Pro NetBeans IDE 6 Rich Client Platform Edition</h1>

<span style="font-style: italic;">February 2008</span><br>
<br>
<br>
Adam Myatt is a speedy writer. <a
 href="http://www.apress.com/book/view/1590598954">Pro NetBeans IDE 6
Rich Client Platform Edition</a>, the second book in his Pro NetBeans
series is due out February 25様ess than a year after the publication of
the inaugural "Pro NetBeans IDE 5.5 Enterprise Edition".<br>
<br>
Myatt, a systems analyst for General Electric Global Research and a
former Eclipse user, began writing Pro NetBeans 6.0 to coincide with
the late Fall 2007 release of the retooled NetBeans IDE. (NetBeans IDE
6.0
was released in December 2007.) <br>
<br>
In this interview he gives a quick overview of what to expect in his
new book.<br>

<h3>What is new in Pro NetBeans IDE 6.0? Is the older book obsolete?<br>
</h3>
<br>
Quite a bit is new in Pro NetBeans IDE 6. It covers many updated
features: debugger,
profiler, visual web applications, as well as many of the new features
in the NetBeans IDE 6.0様ocal history, Ruby support, and so on. As the
rest of the title indicates, there is also a focus on developing rich
clients, whether they be Web, Swing, or NetBeans RCP apps. The <a
 href="http://www.apress.com/book/view/1590597885">Pro NetBeans 5.5</a>
book focuses on Java EE 5 and thus is still very much relevant.<br>
<br>
<h3>Your assessment of NetBeans IDE 6.0用luses and
suggestions?</h3>
<br>
I really love the new editor. It significantly improves the overall
development experience. I also like the updated profiler and the new
local history. What needs work? Well, every tool could always be
better. I'm looking forward to the NetBeans IDE 6.1 performance
release, not just for the improved performance, but also for the
revamped auto comment feature which a number of NetBeans fanatics have
been missing, including myself.<br>
<br>
<h3>The NetBeans IDE is more than a Java IDE; how much of your book
covers working with scripting languages?</h3>
<br>
As far as non-Java goes, one of my contributing authors, Brian Leonard
of the NetBeans Evangelism team, wrote a chapter on JRuby/Ruby on Rails.<br>
<br>
<h3>Geertjan Wielenga, a NetBeans Technical Writer and author of <a
 href="http://vig.prenhall.com/catalog/academic/product/0,1144,0132354802,00.html">Plugging
into the NetBeans Platform</a>, is also a
contributor. How did Brian and Geertjan became involved in Pro NetBeans
6? What chapters did they contribute?</h3>
<br>
I actually met Geertjan last year at JavaOne. We had several
conversations then and via email for several months afterwards. He
kindly offered any advice, assistance, or support that I needed as a
general NetBeans user. One thing led to another and he came on board to
write the last chapter: <span style="font-style: italic;">Developing
Rich Client
Applications</span>. Brian became involved as a referral through
Geertjan and several folks at Sun. I wanted to cover NetBeans 6.0
support for Ruby/JRuby, but it wasn't a topic I knew much about. To do
the topic justice I asked around and Brian certainly fit the bill as
being qualified. He authored chapter 12: <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Developing JRuby/Ruby
on Rails Applications</span>. <br>
<br>
<h3>Is Pro NetBeans 6 beginner-friendly or more suited for those
with prior knowledge of the NetBeans IDE?</h3>
<br>
I think people who are new to NetBeans will find the book inviting and
easy to understand. Experienced NetBeans users will also find lots of
tips and features they may have not known. In particular,&nbsp;I think
there are several areas of the Debugging and
Profiling chapters that are covered that&nbsp;experienced NetBeans
users
will find enlightening.<br>
<br>
<h3>Was there a learning process for you in writing about the NetBeans
IDE 6.0?</h3>
<br>
Only on a few things. I've been through the IDE's features quite
extensively. However, there were areas of the Profiler and the Matisse
GUI Builder I wasn't as familiar with as I would have liked. For the
Profiler, I had to brush up on profiling external and
remote applications. Those features can be a little tricky to figure
out. Regarding Matisse, it is a pretty easy tool to use, but I don't do
a lot of Swing or GUI development on a regular basis so I needed a
refresher. <br>
<br>
<h3>Any more book ideas on the horizon? </h3>
<br>
None for the moment. I am taking a break to enjoy some free time and to
relax. I also want to focus on several open source Java
projects幽udson, Checkstyle, and PMD葉hat I'm passionate about.<br>
