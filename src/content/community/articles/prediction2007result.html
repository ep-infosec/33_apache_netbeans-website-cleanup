<h1>NetBeans Users Expect Linux Adoption
of Java in 2007</h1>
<br>
Our recent poll asked six NetBeans experts to look ahead in 2007 and
make predictions for NetBeans and the Java industry. The NetBeans
community voted over a month and by a narrow margin decided that
Jaroslav &#8220;Yarda&#8221; Tulach&#8217;s prediction was most likely to happen. His
forecast, that Linux users would adopt Java as a result of last year&#8217;s
open-sourcing, received 25% of the votes. Evangelist Gregg Sporar&#8217;s
outlook on the growth of EJB3 and the Java Persistence API was a
close second with 13 less votes. Do NetBeans evangelists know something
most of us don&#8217;t? Another evangelist, Roman Strobl, received the third
most votes
with his prediction that NetBeans would see increased market share.<br>
<br>
<h5>Results of the Poll:</h5>
<br>
<ul>
25% &#8212; Linux community adopts Java (Jaroslav &#8220;Yarda&#8221; Tulach)<br>
  <br>
23% &#8212; EJB3 and the Java Persistence API gain momentum (Gregg Sporar)<br>
  <br>
18% &#8212; NetBeans market share will continue to grow (Roman Strobl)<br>
  <br>
15% &#8212; Java desktop APIs improve (Leonardo Galv√§o)<br>
  <br>
8% &#8212; NetBeans IDE's scripting support attracts new users (Geertjan
Wielenga)<br>
  <br>
5% &#8212; Sun will strengthen its investments in open-source communities
(Bruno Souza)<br>
  <br>
5% &#8212; Others
</ul>
<br>

the detailed predictions</a>.)<br>
<br>
Voters also had the option of casting ballots for their own forecast. A
few entries touched on the after-effects of Java going
open-source, while most anticipated a rise in the number of new and
experienced developers using the NetBeans IDE. Submitted predictions
included:<br>
<br>
<ul>
&#8220;With Visual Web Pack, NetBeans became an alternative to Visual Studio
2005. In the next version of NetBeans, it must be added full support
of Ajax without updating from NetBeans updater.&#8221;<br>
  <br>
&#8220;Thanks to the NetBeans Platform Book, we will see an explosion of
NetBeans Modules.&#8221;<br>
  <br>
&#8220;NetBeans will increase the productivity potential of many thousands of
developers by recognizing the high priority need for, and implementing
VIM (or VIM-like functionality) as an editor choice within the IDE.&#8221;<br>
  <br>
&#8220;Java overcomes current performance limitations due to open-source
efforts.&#8221;<br>
  <br>
&#8220;As much as possible, some developers will develop their applications
using the Ruby language because the Java language is becoming complex
and ugly because of a lack of good language design philosophy.&#8221;
</ul>
<br>
<br>
While the idea of a poll might suggest that there are correct answers
and those that are less so, in an interview about the prediction poll
Tulach thoughtfully
pointed out that there were no right or wrong entries. And perhaps
there is no better evidence of this than the recent &#8220;year in preview&#8221;
article by popular tech blogger <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-java2007.html">
Elliotte Harold</a> in which he expanded on many
of the same points&#8212;Linux adoption of Java, increased NetBeans market
share, and more&#8212;summed up by our NetBeans experts. Thus, an ideal
assessment of the final results should not focus on perceived
shortcomings of any of the six entries, but instead recognize what they
have in common: a positive outlook for NetBeans and Java in 2007.<br>
<br>
Thank you to our six NetBeans experts and all those who voted!<br>

<h5>Congratulations Yarda. Your prediction: &#8220;Linux community adopts
Java&#8221;
received the most votes.</h5>
<br>
Thank you. I am glad the voters found my prediction appealing, however
the important part is to make the prediction really true. Then I'll be
feeling really happy.<br>
<br>
<h5>Let&#8217;s talk a bit more about your prediction. Have you started to
notice
any trends as a result of Java going open-source?</h5>
<br>
Not much happened since last fall (when Sun open-sourced hotspot, javac
and javahelp), I guess people are mostly waiting for Sun to open-source
the rest of the JDK. However we, here in NetBeans, are not just
waiting. I am trying as hard as I can to create RPMs for NetBeans 6.0
so people using RPM-based Linux distribution can just install NetBeans
using the most natural way they are used to. By the way, if anyone
wants to help me in testing these packages, drop me an <a href="mailto:Jaroslav.Tulach@Sun.COM">email</a>, please.<br>
<br>
<h5>What did you think of the other forecasts in the survey?</h5>
<br>
I believe that everyone selected the most important event from area of
own expertise. EJB3 is definitely going to gain momentum; scripting is
likely to gain some attention, also due to improved NetBeans support. So
it is just a matter of choosing absolute winner from all the "local"
winners.<br>
<br>
<h5>If your prediction turns out to be right, will you consider
becoming a
&#8220;Tech Psychic&#8221;?</h5>
<br>
No. If you look at Bruno's and Leonardo's predictions, they are almost
the same as mine, that is why it seems there is no magic in predicting
success of open-source Java. People who believe in open-source are
generally convinced this is going to be big.<br>
<br>
<h5>Your picture is rather unique. Can you tell us more about the
sketch?</h5>
<br>
There is not much to say. Many years ago I was dating a painter....<br>
