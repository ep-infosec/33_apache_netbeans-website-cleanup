<h1>Schwartz Joins NB Evangelism Team; Everyone Grows Ponytails</h1>
<i>April 1, 2007</i><br>
<br><br>
Jonathan Schwartz rocked the technical community
when he announced his new role as NetBeans Evangelist, giving up his
position as CEO of Sun Microsystems.<br>
<br>
"NetBeans is the best d@*$ development environment, everybody knows that!"
Schwartz included in his announcement. "I love the NetBeans community,
and I feel like it's my home."<br>
<br>
In solidarity, NetBeans Evangelists and community members grew ponytails overnight.<br>
