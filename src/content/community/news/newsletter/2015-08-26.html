This ends a cycle that started some months ago, with many in the NetBeans community being involved. Several people from the NetBeans Dream Team, as well as teachers using NetBeans around the world, and some of the subscribers on the NetBeans mailing list. Read all about it here.</p>

				<h2><a href="http://services.netbeans.org/newsletter/story.php?id=10200">Write Once Run Anywhere with DukeScript</a></h2>
						<p style="margin-left:8px;">
						For quite some time already, Java has been failing on its “write once, run anywhere” promise. DukeScript would like to change that by enabling a clean separation of view and logic in cross-platform applications. In this article, a simple scenario is used to introduce the basics of DukeScript.</p>

				<div class="item">
				<h2><a href="http://services.netbeans.org/newsletter/story.php?id=10199">Hello World in Vaadin & DukeScript</a></h2>
						<p style="margin-left:8px;">
						On the face of it, Vaadin—and GWT in general—has a lot in common with DukeScript. Both are focused on providing browser-oriented solutions for Java developers and have good integration with IDEs, thanks to their native support for Maven. However, these aspects are really all that they have in common. From the programming model, to how the frameworks process the code, to how applications are deployed, Vaadin and DukeScript are totally different.</p>

				<h2><a href="http://services.netbeans.org/newsletter/story.php?id=10207">YouTube: Chrome Connector Plugin in NetBeans IDE 8.1</a></h2>
						<p style="margin-left:8px;">
						NetBeans IDE 8.1, which is currently in Beta, has some awesome enhancements for working with the Chrome browser via the Chrome Connector plugin. In particular, Polymer is supported for the first time via live Shadow DOM visualization and Knockout.js is even further integrated into the development cycle via a new window that shows live Knockout bindings of the currently selected item in the Chrome browser.</p>
