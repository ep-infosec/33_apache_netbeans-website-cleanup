NetBeans Plugins I Use, Part 5: Build Monitor
Tor Norbye writes, "The Build Monitor plugin for NetBeans allows you to
see the status of continuous builds, right from within the IDE. The
Build Monitor works with several continuous build systems -
CruiseControl, Hudson, and of course the NetBeans continuous build. You
can monitor multiple build sources - all you do is name your build and
point to an RSS feed where the plugin can fetch the build status."
