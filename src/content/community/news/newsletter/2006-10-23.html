more reasons: Java EE 5, SOA, mobile and visual web development and you.

Window Layouts and NetBeans Platform Applications
The NetBeans Window System API lets you manage your application's
window system. For example, you can create a new position in your
window layout for a TopComponent. Or you can split the area in which a
TopComponent is found, and share that area with one or more other
TopComponents. For details on these ways of manipulating your window
system, see Geertjan's blog entries "Creating A New Mode In Your
Application" ( &lt;<a href="http://services.netbeans.org/newsletter/story.php?id=871">http://services.netbeans.org/newsletter/story.php?id=871</a>&gt; )
and "Creating A New Split For An Existing Mode"
