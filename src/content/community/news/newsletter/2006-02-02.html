Keep Those Plug-in Modules Compatible
How do you ensure that the plug-in module you're developing in a
development build will be usable by somebody using NetBeans IDE 5.0?
Considering that, if you don't take special steps, you'll end up with a
plug-in module that is incompatible with the IDE used by your target
audience, it's a good idea to check out Geertjan's blog:
