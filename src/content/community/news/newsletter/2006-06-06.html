Using Hibernate with the Java Persistence API
One of the main features of the new Java Persistence API that was
introduced with the Java EE 5 platform is that you can plug in any
persistence provider that you want. The Sun Java System Application
Server 9 ships with Oracle's Toplink persistence provider. In this
tutorial, you will install the Hibernate persistence provider on the
application server and use it to develop a quick application that
accesses a database with the Java Persistence API.

Introduction to Java Servlets with NetBeans
At the completion of the tutorial, you are expected to comprehend the
concept of the Java Servlet, be familiar with the ways to create Java
Servlet using NetBeans 5.0, differences between POST and GET and should
be ready to go to the next level.

A Single-Mouse-Gesture Color Chooser for Swing
Have you ever needed a faster, slicker way to let your users select a
color in Swing? Tim Boudreau has setup a new java.net project, which
produces such a widget. Press the mouse and a palette pops up; drag
over the palette and release when the color is right; use combinations
of ctrl/alt/shift to switch palettes.
