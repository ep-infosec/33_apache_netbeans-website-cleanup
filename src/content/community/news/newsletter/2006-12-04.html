NetBeans 6.0 Milestone 5 Now Available
Milestone 5 is a "big bang" for NetBeans as it includes the initial
version of the improved Java editor and the new Java language
infrastructure that is based on the Javac. The APIs will give you full
access to the Javac APIs for given source. Many modules from the J2EE
area are disabled and we don't recommend to use the milestone for
production work, however you can try out the new features.
&lt;<a href="http://services.netbeans.org/newsletter/story.php?id=934">http://services.netbeans.org/newsletter/story.php?id=934</a>&gt;
Pictures tell you more about these features so be sure check them out.
