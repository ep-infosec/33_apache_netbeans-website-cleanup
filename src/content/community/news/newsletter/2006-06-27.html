Visual Mobile Designer Custom Components: Creating Mobile Splash Screens
Typically, you use a splash screen when a program starts, or to display
a logo or branding information. It gives users the first impression of
your application. As you'll see in this tutorial, the Visual Mobile
Designer (VMD) in the NetBeans Mobility Pack makes it easy to design a
splash screen for a Mobile application, and implement it using the
SplashScreen custom component included in the VMD's palette.

Powerful Reporting Functionality
Incorporating the OpenOffice.org API into a NetBeans Platform
application lets you produce highly complex text documents,
spreadsheets, and graphs. Geertjan's blog provides a lot of basic
information, including reusable code snippets, describing, for example,
how to connect to an OpenOffice.org installation and how to transfer a
Swing JTable's contents to a text table in an OpenOffice.org Writer
document. For details, read all three parts, linked here:

Hyperlinks in Maven POMs
Milos Klient writes, "The Maven POM file contains a lot of useful
information but it's not always ready at hand. While browsing some
pom.xml file and copy-pasting the url contained there, I thought there
must be a better way. Why not have the URLs hyperlinked?" Take a look
at his results.
