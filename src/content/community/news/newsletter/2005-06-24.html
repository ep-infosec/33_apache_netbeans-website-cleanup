HiT Software Releases Allora 4.1
HiT Software launched a new new release of Allora, its SQL middleware
product for moving data between XML and major relational database formats,
including DB2/400. Version 4.1 has added a multiple SELECT feature that lets
users perform multiple SQL queries that are then joined in real time using
XSL. HiT Software says the product previously was able to handle complex
database-to-XML transformations with a single SQL query, but there are cases
where the single SQL query approach is not ideal. The new multiple SELECT
feature will also enable users to keep their complete database structures,
including data table relationships and constraints, in XML, which will be
useful for database migrations. Other enhancements in Allora 4.1 include
support for namespace definitions, complex database expressions, NetBeans
IDE 4.1, and stored procedures in Oracle databases.
