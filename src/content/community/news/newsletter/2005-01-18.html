The Profiler is an add-on to NetBeans 4.1, 4.0 or 3.6, and adds a fully
featured CPU, memory and threads profiling capabilities, tightly
integrated into the IDE workflow. What's new in the Beta (Milestone 4)
release?

  reduce the profiling overhead based on package names
* configurable filters for displaying results, which allow much easier
  evaluation of the profiling results by focusing on specific packages,
  classes or methods
* enhanced integration with NetBeans 4.0 and 4.1, providing direct
  support for J2SE and Freeform project types and easier integration
  with other project types via custom profiling Ant tasks

Ant Debugger Module Released
NetBeans Ant Debugger is intended to facilitate finding and fixing bugs
in Ant scripts. This tool could be usefully for wide range of users,
from beginners just starting to learn Ant framework to advanced
developers who work with complex scripts on a daily basis. Ant Debugger
makes it easy to see how Ant targets and tasks are structured and
executed - including interdependencies, i.e. what is called from which
place. It allows to see Ant properties and to easily put breakpoints on
property definitions. A user then can step through scripts, watch
properties, skip targets, and put breakpoints on interesting places..
Current version of Ant debugger is available on Developer Update Center.
