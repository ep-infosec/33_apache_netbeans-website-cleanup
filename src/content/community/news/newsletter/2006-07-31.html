<hr><pre>[ANNOUNCE] NetBeans IDE 5.0 BlueJ Edition
This special edition of NetBeans IDE is a collaboration between the
NetBeans community and the University of Kent, England. The NetBeans
IDE BlueJ Edition is targeted at teachers and students familiar with
the popular BlueJ tool. The NetBeans BlueJ Edition helps you "make the
jump" from BlueJ to a full-featured IDE, either when your projects have
grown too big to fit comfortably into BlueJ, or when you want to use
features such as code completion and drag-and-drop GUI building, which
BlueJ doesn't directly support. To learn more about using BlueJ and
NetBeans in education see:

Developing GUIs on Mac OS X
NetBeans developers have gone out of their way to make using NetBeans

alike. Project Matisse allows you to create a truly cross-platform UI,
just by dragging and dropping.

Rendering Nodes Creatively
When developing NetBeans modules, how do you render your nodes? In a
tree structure, probably. Do you know that you could also render those
same nodes as icons? In a combobox? In a menu button? A lot more is
possible than you think, with the org.openide.explorer.view package.
And it really couldn't be simpler. Geertjan's blog tells you all about it:

The IDE's Output Window in Your Own Application?
Hermann Matthes started an interesting thread on the nbdev mailing list
on the question of how to include the NetBeans IDE Output window in
your own rich-client application. And... at the end he got it to work!
Have a look at the discussion, which ended here:

Java Web Start: NetBeans vs. Eclipse
"I will have to work on the deployment of an Eclipser RCP application
via Java Web Start," writes the author of Application-Servers,com, in
French. "NetBeans 5.0 could perhaps facilitate work for me... On this
subject, NetBeans seems better equipped that Eclipse." Read more about
it here, in French:

NetBeans... In Action at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth!
Last week we reported that the Open University uses NetBeans to teach
Java. Guess what? If you go to the University of Wales, Aberystwyth,
you will find NetBeans in use there too. Chris Loftus, the course
instructor, wrote to tell us about the Server-Side Software Development
course: (&lt;<a href="http://services.netbeans.org/newsletter/story.php?id=666">http://services.netbeans.org/newsletter/story.php?id=666</a>&gt; and the
Distributed Systems Project course:
(&lt;<a href="http://services.netbeans.org/newsletter/story.php?id=667">http://services.netbeans.org/newsletter/story.php?id=667</a>&gt;.
Both make use of NetBeans IDE! Do you know of other universities and
colleges using NetBeans out there? Write and let us know!

NetBeans Evandalists Go to Space
"Few people know that Java SE originally stood for Java Spaceship
Edition. Now that the space shuttle has landed safely, we can finally
tell the truth about what really happened up there, and how NetBeans,
once more, saved the day." Check out Ruth's latest 2 part cartoon:
