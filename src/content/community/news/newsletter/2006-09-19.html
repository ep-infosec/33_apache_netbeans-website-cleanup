James Gosling: For Ruby or Ajax or SOA, it's NetBeans
Rich Seeley, a news writer for SearchWebServices.com writes, "What does
the Father of Java think of the emerging interest in rival languages
such as Ruby? A lover of diversity, James Gosling says he's played
around with Ruby enough to understand the attraction, but his heart
belongs to Java and what Sun Microsystems Inc. is pulling together
under the NetBeans tent. He understands why Ajax coders are frustrated
with JavaScript, but he says the answer will be found in NetBeans."
