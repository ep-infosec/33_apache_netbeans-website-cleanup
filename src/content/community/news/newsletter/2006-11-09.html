NetBeans: The Complete Overview

applications from existing data, and editing annotations. (October 31, Tech

JavaTools Newsletter Special Feature: The 30 Days IDE Swap Experiment
Wouldn't be interesting if an Eclipse fan would use NetBeans for a while and
vice-versa, so we could see what features the users miss most on one IDE and
then, in the end, provide information to make both IDEs better? Four volunteers
from four different countries accepted the challenge of using a different IDE
for 30 Days. Here are their journals during the experiment and their final
interviews. If you ever thought about moving to another IDE, their stories will
give you some interesting information.

jMaki Support in NetBeans
Ludo has extended his jMaki support module. It now includes wizards that let you
specify the layout of your JSP page. No need to know about CSS stylesheets,
because this wizard generates  all the necessary CSS styles for you. Check it
out here:

Web developers and module development
You're a web developer, creating some JSP pages and servlets and so on. Do you
know how easy it is to add new functionality to the IDE? Here, in Geertjan's
blog, you find out how to create a new menu item that adds <b></b> tags around a
selected text:

Charles Ditzel and Looking Glass
"NetBeans is a great environment to work on Looking Glass," writes Charles
Ditzel in his blog
(&lt;<a href="http://cld.blog-city.com/netbeans_ide_55_tutorial__developing_looking_glass_sof">http://cld.blog-city.com/netbeans_ide_55_tutorial__developing_looking_glass_sof</a>&gt;
tware.htm). He also points out a great tutorial called "Building and Running
Project Looking Glass with NetBeans"
