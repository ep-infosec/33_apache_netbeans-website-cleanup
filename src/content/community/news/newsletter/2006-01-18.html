Publish Plug-ins Painlessly (Part 1)
In 5.0, creating the framework of a plug-in module is a piece of cake. But,
after you finish developing the plug-in module, how do you publish it? It's
really a lot easier than you might think. Let Geertjan show you how. In his
blog he explains the steps you should take when creating an Update Center.
Don't really know what an "Update Center" is? That's another reason to read
his blog:

Using Java Web Start to Launch NetBeans
Charles Ditzel writes, "If you missed Hans Muller's blog you missed a very
nice achievement.  Hans has used Java Web Start to launch NetBeans.  This
achievement allows you to select a link on a web page and boom - it loads
NetBeans over the wire.  As one developer said - "Wow, this is one of those
eye-opening experiences...". It is."

Developer.com Winners for 2006
Lukas Hasik writes, "Sun is listed 5 times in list of winners published on
Developers.com. I glad to see Sun listed there and winning the prices but...
Personally I'm little bit disappointed that NetBeans or Mobility Pack are not
listed there. How could Wireless ToolKit (WTK) beat Mobility Pack?"
