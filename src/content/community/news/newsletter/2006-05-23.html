Java EE Persistence in a Web Project
This document takes you through the basics of developing a Java web
application with stand-alone persistence using Java EE 5 technology.
This document uses the NetBeans 5.5 Preview Release, which is bundled
with the Beta release of the Sun Java System Application Server 9.0,
Platform Edition.

Java EE and J2EE 1.4 Compared
This document takes the same sample J2EE application that is created in
the NetBeans 4.1/J2EE 1.4 Quick Start Guide and creates it with the
NetBeans 5.5 Preview with Java EE 5 technology. You will see that
hooking up a web application to a database on the server is much
simpler using Java EE 5 persistence.

UML Modeling: Developing Applications
In this walk through, you learn how to use the UML modeling features of
the NetBeans integrated development environment (IDE) to create a

test class.

Coming Attractions - Visual Design Tools for Creating Web Applications
Those attending NetBeans Day at Java One this year had a sneak preview
of an exciting new feature running on the beta release of NetBeans 5.5.
Sandip Chitale showed how one can quickly develop web applications
using Java Server Faces components through a powerful drag-and-drop
user interface and easily integrate with heterogeneous data sources
such as relational databases and web services. Those who use Java
Studio Creator already appreciate the power of these visual editors.
Soon, these features will be available to NetBeans users as well. Take
an online tour of this coming attraction.
