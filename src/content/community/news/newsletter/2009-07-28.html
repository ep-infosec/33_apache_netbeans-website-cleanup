						<p style="margin-left:8px;">
						"The latest version of the NetBeans IDE is a x.7 release, but it includes so many new features it could rightfully receive a full version increment.

						<p style="margin-left:8px;">
						When System and Software Architect Hermann didn't find a time keeping application suitable for the needs of all the roles typically involved in his projects, he used the NetBeans Platform to write his own: "I use a lot of NetBeans Platform modules for features which I otherwise would have to write myself. And I'm not sure if I would be able to implement them with the same level of quality as I get (and for free!) from the NetBeans Platform."</p>
