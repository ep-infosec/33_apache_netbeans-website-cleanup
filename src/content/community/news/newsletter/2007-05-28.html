						<p style="margin-left:8px;">
						We're happy to report that many of you have downloaded NetBeans 6.0 Preview (Milestone 9) and have actively given feedback. The good news is? A lot of your responses have been positive. A sample:<br><br>
<i>I had tried the earlier versions of NetBeans and found it not usable at all. But version 5.5 and 6.0 is amazing. I don't think there is any IDE in the market which supports the variety of features that NetBeans does. <b>Meera S.</b></i><br><br>
And the not-so positive ones? We're listening to those as well, and working hard to improve the NetBeans experience for ALL. So <a href="https://netbeans.org/community/releases/60/index.html">Download M9</a> and let us know what you think.
