<hr><pre>Deploying Web Applications to Sun Java System Web Server 7.0 With
NetBeans 5.0
Great news for Web developers! You can install an open-source Web
Server plug-in into the NetBeans 5.0 IDE from its Auto Update Center.
That means you can develop, deploy, and debug J2EE 1.4 platform-based
Web applications directly from the IDE. This article shows you how,
complete with screen shots.

Using Java Persistence in a J2EE 1.4 Web Application
This document takes you through the basics of how to add Java
Persistence functionality to a J2EE 1.4 web application. Though the
Java Persistence API was introduced as part of the Java EE 5 platform,
it is possible to use Java Persistence in a J2EE 1.4 application. The
target container needs to be running on JDK 1.5, but it does not need
to be a Java EE 5 container. This means that we can use the Tomcat web
server bundled with the IDE. We add support for Java Persistence
functionality by adding the TopLink Essentials library to the classpath
of the project or the container. The TopLink Essentials library is
bundled with NetBeans IDE 5.5.

AVK Plug-in for NetBeans 5.5 Now Available (Beta Version)
A newer version of the "Sun Java System Application Verification Kit"
plug-in with rich user interface is now available at NetBeans
Development Update Center. This plug-in helps application developers to
test their applications for correct use of Java EE APIs and portability
across Java EE compatible application servers. The tool determines that
an application suite follows the Java EE platform specification
(including all the specifications for the technologies that are part of
the platform) and that it runs on the Application Server.
