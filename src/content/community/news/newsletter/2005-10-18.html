talks about NetBeans 5.0, NetBeans Profiler and the changing Java IDE market. He shares
his views on plug-in development for the NetBeans platform and on Eclipse. He also
elaborates on why he thinks the field is wide open for client frameworks for desktop
java apps and how it could come down to Swing versus SWT. Rich is a current member of the
