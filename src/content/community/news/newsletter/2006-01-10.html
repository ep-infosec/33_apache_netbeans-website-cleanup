Dynamic Bytecode Instrumentation
Profiling Java applications is often considered a black art. There are
tools available to help you track down performance bottlenecks and memory-
allocation problems, but they are not always easy to use, particularly when
profiling large applications. Because large applications tend to be those
that most need profiling, this presents a significant problem. Dynamic
bytecode instrumentation is an innovative solution to these problems. It
lets you control precisely which parts of an application are profiled.
