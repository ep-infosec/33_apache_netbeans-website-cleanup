Server Plug-ins Project with Support for JBoss, WebLogic and WebSphere
A new project, which aims to provide support for deployment of J2EE
applications to JBoss, BEA WebLogic and IBM WebSphere servers, was started.
Initial sources for three new server plugins were uploaded to the netbeans.org
source repository. For information on how to build and try out the server
plugins, see the project home page at:

Now that JBoss 4, WebLogic 9, and WebSphere 6 can be installed in the IDE as
plug-ins (&lt;<a href="http://serverplugins.netbeans.org/">http://serverplugins.netbeans.org/</a>&gt; ) you might be wondering what the
Runtime window looks like when all the IDE's supported servers are registered
at the same time. It's definitely a colorful picture! Click here to see for
yourself:

You Want More Refactorings?
... here they come! The refactoring team is working on many experimental
refactorings at the moment. You can download them from the development update
center of 5.0. You can try these features out and file bugs, send
recommendations, etc. They're not for production use yet - no quality is
guaranteed at them moment (it's the bleeding edge development).

distillation of that entire process. Take a look at Bill's Newbee NetBeans
