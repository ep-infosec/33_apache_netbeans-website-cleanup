				<h2><a href="http://services.netbeans.org/newsletter/story.php?id=1178">New Dynamic Faces Component Library Enables You to Ajaxify Plain Old Java Server Faces Components</a></h2>
						<p style="margin-left:8px;">
						The Update Center now offers a new Dynamic Faces component library that enables you to employ Ajax techniques with Visual Web Pack JavaServer Faces components. Dynamic Faces technology is an extension to the JavaServer Faces framework. Its purpose, in short, is to submit a subset of web page inputs via an Ajax request, execute over a subset of nodes in the server-side component tree, and emit an Ajax response that causes a subset of nodes in the web page Document Object Model (DOM) to be re-rendered.
<br>
<br>
Also available from the Update Center is a Currency Trader sample application that demonstrates the Dynamic Faces technology. To learn more, see <a href="https://netbeans.org/kb/55/vwp-instcurrencytrader.html">Installing the Currency Trader Sample Application</a> available from the <a href="https://netbeans.org/kb/55/vwp-index.html">NetBeans Visual Web Pack 5.5 Documentation page<a>.</p>
