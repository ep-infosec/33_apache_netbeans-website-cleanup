A Really Bare-Bones Platform
Tim Boudreau writes, "My friend Jarda has a NetBeans-based application
which uses only the NetBeans module system - i.e. you can use the NB
module system to write server-side modular applications or whatever you
want." Read more at

NetBeans 5.5 Beta 2 Satisfaction Research
We recently asked NetCAT 5.5 participants about their experience with
NetBeans 5.5 Beta 2 and were very pleased by the results. The research
proved that Beta 2 is far better that Beta 1 in stability. According to
the answers performance is also good except slow code completion.
Besides, we asked about freeform projects and it looks like the usage
is low and people prefer NetBeans projects. If you want to provide your
own answers, don't hesitate to reply in this thread:

JAX-WS Customizations Made Easy with NetBeans 5.5
NetBeans 5.5 with its built-in support for JAX-WS Web Services also
provides a nice GUI to customize WSDL to Java bindings easily. All it
takes is a few clicks as shown in this blog.

J2EE 5 Project and Mobility Pack 5.5
Mobility Pack has two wizards for creating connection to a server: J2ME
Web Service Client - generates client using Webservices API (JSR172) &
Mobile Client to Web Application - generates a server part and a client
part that communicates together. You can generate mobile clients to
Webservice client too. The Mobile Client to Web Application needs an
Web Application with webservice client, a class or a servlet that will
provide data to it. Unfortunately the Mobile Client to Web Application
doesn't work with JAX-WS 2.0 webservice clients. Read more from Lukas.
