NetBeans Hands-On Labs at JavaOne '06
Developers are telling us they love hands-on labs because they learn
new and exciting Java technologies by actually getting their hands
dirty. The popularity of hands-on labs was in fact proven in previous
JavaOne conferences. This year, there will be 19 instructor-led hands-
on labs and 18 non-instructor-led labs, which include several labs that
will let JavaOne attendees to learn and explore the exciting features
of NetBeans. For a list of these NetBeans related labs and other JavaOne
conference activities continue here.

Under the Hood of NetBeans 5.5
Geertjan writes, "NetBeans IDE 5.5 will totally redefine the word
"productivity". I mean, forget wimpy little bits of code, pretty little
samples, and obsequious hints and suggestions. Think big. How big? Well,
how big can you think? That's how big, plus a little bit of extra
bigness added on top." Be sure to check out his two part look at the
Best Feature of NetBeans IDE 5.5.

Developing Java Applications for Pocket PCs Using NetBeans -
A Dream or Reality?
A recently released preview of Mobility Pack for CDC allows development
of Java applications for Symbian based devices, in particular for the
Sony Ericsson P990 and Nokia Series 80, which feature a CDC
configuration with Personal Profile. Unfortunately, the tool cannot be
used out of box with one of the platforms, which is quite widespread
these days,- PDAs running Microsoft Windows Mobile operating system.
Luckily, because of extremely versatile build system used in NetBeans,
it is not difficult to a basic support for deploying and running the
developed application on a Pocket PC device (or emulator).

Help Spread NetBeans Virally with the Profiler
This is an interesting blog entry by Cote, a Software Industry Analyst
with Redmonk. To take a direct quote, "Put another way, the NetBeans
Profiler was the reason I started using NetBeans again. While I didn't
use it for development, I downloaded and installed it, and I'd be lying
if I said I didn't think of trying out NetBeans again for development."

NetBeans Evandalists Cartoon
They are cool. They are witty. Spreading Java technology is their
mission. NetBeans is their IDE. This cartoon is not about them. It's
about their dyslectic little brothers -- the NetBeans Evandalists!
