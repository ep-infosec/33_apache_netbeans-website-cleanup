<hr><pre>NetBeans Day 2005 - Standing Room Only
JavaOne started a day early with the kick off of the 2nd annual NetBeans Day
event. It was clear from the very earliest hours that this year's event was
sure to be a success. With a line that was weaving out of the Argent hotel
lobby and a pumped up audience, several high profiler announcements were made.
If you are interested in reading about the event Gregg Sporar has provided a
beautiful recap which can be found here.

Try Mattise - The New NetBeans GUI Builder Now!
The next generation layout builder blew away the crowd at NetBeans Day when
Roman Guy was able to build a complete MP3 player in under 5 minutes! Read how
to access it in the latest development builds, and take it for a test drive
yourself.

The NetBeans Collaboration Project - At the 2nd Annual NetBeans Day Sun
Microsystem's Chief Operating Office Johnathan Schwartz and Todd Fast made an
important announcement: code-aware developer collaboration will be added to
NetBeans. What is "code-aware" develop collaboration? The easiest way to think
about is this: instant messaging (IM) inside your IDE. But it is not just an IM
client. You can share windows and even allow another developer to run commands on
your system. For those of you familiar with Sun's Java Studio Enterprise (which
is built on top of NetBeans), this feature is not new. Today's announcement was
that this functionality is being open sourced and put into NetBeans. This is great
is you need to discuss code with other developers remotely or want to conduct a
code review with a distributed team.

NetBeans Honors It's Own in a Community Awards Session
NetBeans is a community, and there are some people who have made outstanding
contributions to that community. The NetBeans Community Awards were presented by
James Gosling. This year's recipients were Vincent Brabant, Maxym Mykhalchuk,
Manfred Riem, Bruno Souza, and Rich Unger. Each recipient was awarded a cool piece
of original James Gosling art, a framed certificate, and a brand new ultra-fast
Sun Ultra 20 workstation.

Project Looking Glass & NetBeans - Your Challenge
What if your desktop were actually a 3D environment? What if your CD or movie
database becomes a 3D jukebox? Project Looking Glass is based on Java technology
and  explores bringing a richer user experience to the desktop and applications
via 3D windowing and visualization capabilities. The Looking Glass Project is
interested in the possibility of a NetBeans module specifically for Looking Glass
development, and put out a request for anyone who would be interested in
developing one. If you are interested then get in touch  with the most active
project on java.net at &lt;<a href="http://lg3d-core.dev.java.net/">http://lg3d-core.dev.java.net/</a>&gt;.  Charlie Hunt has
written an excellent article on how to use NetBeans to easily check out the code
and then build/run Looking Glass.

Growing NetBeans: A Conversation With Trung Duc Tran, Chief Architect
For those of you who don't know Trungr is responsible for setting the direction of
NetBeans and for assuring strong tool support for the core technologies of the Java
platform. Trung joined Sun Microsystems in 2000 and has been working on NetBeans ever
since. He built the perf team for NetBeans 3.5, a completely new windowing system in
3.6, and a new project system based on Apache Ant, which is at the core of NetBeans
4.0. This interview explores the challenges of creating a quality tool.
