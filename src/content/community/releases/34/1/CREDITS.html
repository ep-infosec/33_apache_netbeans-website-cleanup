<P>The personal Thank-Yous of Maxym Mykhalchuk (Merak release coordinator), 
of course subject to my personal feelings and in no particular order.
I owe those people certainly more than I've written after "for", but that'd be
too long to write here:
</P>
<ul>
    <li>to Jesse Glick, for answering very many (really many) my stupid
        questions.
    <li>to Vincent Brabant, for constant support of my initiative - answering
        in the newsgroups ab' Merak, announcing, writing nice html docs...
    <li>to James Gordon, for the e-mail storm :-)
    <li>to Sergey Samoshkin, for not discharging me from the office.
</ul>

<P>
