<h1>NetBeans 3.5 Russian Edition Release Schedule</h1>

<p>NetBeans 3.5 Russian Edition is based on code and English (original) 
resources of already released NetBeans 3.5, please see 
<a href="../">3.5 planning</a> for more info.

<p>Please note, that this is not a normal NetBeans release, it doesn't add any
