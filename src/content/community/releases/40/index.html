<p>Here's a quick rundown of the new features listed above, with screenshots
where available.  Click the screenshots for full size images.</p>



<h2><a name="build">Project System Based on Apache Ant</a></h2>
<b>Highlights:</b>
<ul><li>Apache Ant is used as a build engine</li>
<li>Project metadata are Ant build scripts</li>
<li>Ability to build apps outside of the IDE using Ant, no special action ("export to Ant") is required</li>
<li>Fully integrated support for unit testing (JUnit)</li>
<li>User sources are presented in the context of their project in a logical way</li>
<li>The user can work with multiple projects at the same time</li>
<li>All of the above is there out-of-the box, no special setup isrequired from the user</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Description:</b>
<br>A completely new project system based on <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a>, a proven de-facto
open source standard build tool for developing applications using Java
technologies. This new system will have an open architecture, which
third-party modules can extend to support current and future types of
java applications. NetBeans will include project types for J2SE desktop
and two-tier web applications (JSPs, servlets, tag libraries) out of the
box. Users will not have to fear of being locked into a proprietary
project or build system.  The usual users don't have to know Ant to use
the system, but the full power of Ant is accessible to the advanced Ant
users.</p>

<h2><a name="refactor">Refactoring</a></h2>

<a href="../../../images_www/screenshots/4.0/Refactoring1.png" title="Refactoring Screenshot 1"><img src="../../../images_www/screenshots/4.0/Refactoring1_201x141.png" width="201" height="141" border="0" alt="Refactoring Screenshot 1" style="float:right;" hspace="6"></a>

<b>Highlights:</b>
<ul>
<li>Rename Class/Method/Field</li>
<li>Move Class</li>
<li>Rename Package</li>
<li>Change method signature</li>
<li>Encapsulate field</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Description:</b>
<br>The refactoring in 4.0 will provide features such as Renames (Class/Method/Field), Move Class, Rename Package, Change method signature,
Encapsulate field, Find References/Declaration and Go to super implementation.</p>

<a href="../../../images_www/screenshots/4.0/Refactoring2.png" title="Refactoring Screenshot 2"><img src="../../../images_www/screenshots/4.0/Refactoring2_200x141.png" width="200" height="141" border="0" alt="Refactoring Screenshot 2" style="float:right;" hspace="6"></a>

<h2><a name="jdk">J2SE 1.5 Support</a></h2>
<b>Highlights:</b>

<ul>
<li>IDE will run on J2SE 1.5, final version</li>
<li>Support for new language constructs in the editor</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Description:</b>
<br>Once J2SE 1.5 is released you will be able to use new language
constructs, such as enums, generics or metadata annotations to build and
edit your application without additional setup.</p>

<p>Features like error annotations (error underlying) or code folding
will  work with 1.5 sources and the editor will recognize and color new
language keywords.</p>



<br clear="all">
<h2><a name="j2ee">Web Application Development Improvements</a></h2>
<b>Highlights:</b>
<ul>
<li>Web Application project type</li>
<li>Enhanced support for both J2EE 1.3 (Servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2) and J2EE 1.4 (Servlet 2.4 and JSP 2.0) 2-tier web applications </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Description:</b>
<br>The new project system including the Web Application project type
(described above) is the major feature for Web Application developers.
It will allow developing applications using natural and practical source
structures, more easily manage libraries and provide more integrated
build capability for web applications including war archive packaging.
NetBeans 4.0 will also have extended support for both the J2EE 1.3 and
J2EE 1.4 standard. Additionally, NetBeans 4.0 will contain enhancements
in the areas of JSP editing, deployment, debugging, server management,
support for the latest Tomcat and others.</p>


<h2><a name="mobility">Mobility</a></h2>

<b>Highlights:</b>

<ul>
<li>Support for Java(tm) 2 Micro Edition (J2ME(tm)) MIDP 2.0 and CLDC 1.1 standards</li>

<li>J2ME MIDP type project support</li>

<li>Various J2ME MIDP example projects</li>

<li>Integrated with the J2ME Wireless Toolkit 2.2</li>

<li>Supports integration with other third-party emulator platforms</li>

<li>Solves device fragmentation by enabling code development for device configurations</li>

<li>Integrated obfuscation and optimization support</li>

<li>Over-the-Air (OTA) download testing</li>

</ul>


<p><b>Description:</b>

<br>J2ME Development Support lets users  write, test, and debug

applications for Java technology-enabled mobile devices. It integrates

support for MIDP 2.0/CLDC 1.1 and code obfuscation with the new NetBeans

4.0 projects system This release simplifies coding with templates for

MIDlet and MIDlet suites, and provides code completion against J2ME

packages. You can integrate third-party emulators and create device

"configurations" for a robust testing environment.

<h2><a name="debugger">Debugger Improvements</a></h2>
<b>Highlights:</b>

<ul>
<li>New Debugger APIs</li>
<li>Usability and productivity improvements</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Description:</b>
<br>Core Debugger is an important part of the IDE, that is being
extended by many other modules such as JSP debugger. New Debugger APIs
will be a major improvements in terms of architectural extensibility,
overall maintainability, and testability, as well as providing a more
reliable threading model and full JSR45 support.</p>

<p>In addition to that, there are many new features to enable more
productive complex apps debugging, such as step filtering, threads &
callstack views filtering, as well as allowing threads to stop at
breakpoints independently. Debugger will also support the new JDK 1.5
language features, so it would be possible to use new language
constructs in writing expressions for watches and conditional
breakpoints.</p>

<h2><a name="winsys">Windowing System Improvements</a></h2>

<a href="../../../images_www/screenshots/4.0/Outline.png" title="Windowing System"><img src="../../../images_www/screenshots/4.0/Outline_200x141.png" width="200" height="141" border="0" alt="Windowing System" style="float:right;" hspace="6"></a>

<b>Highlights:</b>
<ul>
<li>Multiple views/editors per object: the user can easily switch
between different views of a single object (for example java

deployment descriptor), no need to open new window for each view
and searching for them all the time</li>
<li>Visual alignment with Aqua LookAndFeel on MacOS X, and native
GNOME themes on Unices (GTK LookAndFeel)</li>
<li>auto-hide (sliding) windows</li>
